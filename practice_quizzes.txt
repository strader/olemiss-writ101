Which of the following lines reveals the purpose of Kennedy's speech?
1. Today I want to discuss education with you - the current crisis in our educational system is a crisis caused by our failure to meet our responsibilities over the past 8 years; and tell you what I think we must do in the future to build an educational system to meet our expanding needs.*
~feedback: Correct. Purpose refers to what the speaker is trying to accomplish.

## 1.3 Evaluate strategies for retaining new words
### 1.3.1 Identify strategies for using context clues

~file: context_clues_practice1

// Excelsior OWL question
Which type of context clue is being used in the following passage? <p><strong>Parallax</strong> is becoming a common effect used in mobile device screens. <em>With this effect,</em> the direction of objects on the screen appears to shift depending on the position of the viewer.</p>
1. Adjacent Clue* 
~feedback: That's correct. Even if you don't know what <strong>parallax</strong> is, if you keep reading you can determine its meaning from the rest of the passage. 
2. Definition Clue
~feedback: That's not correct. The passage doesn't explicitly define <strong>parallax</strong>. We can only determine the meaning from the proximity of other words and phrases.
3. Example Clue
~feedback: That's not correct. Though this passage explains how <strong>parallax</strong> works, it doesn't provide an actual example of the effect. 

Which type of context clue is being used in the following passage? <p><strong>Obfuscation</strong>, <em>or</em> intentionally making things difficult to understand, was Senator Biddy's main strategy in the agriculture committee.
1. Definition Clue*
~feedback: That's correct. The appositive after <em>or</em> provides an informal definition for the word. You could switch the word order, making "obfuscation" the appositive, and the sentence would still make sense. 
2. Synonym Clue
~feedback: That's not correct. Synonyms typically mean the same thing as the original word, but don't necessarily break it down any more. A synonym of <p><strong>obfuscation</strong> might be <em>over-complication</em>.
3. Experience Clue
~feedback: That's not correct. Nothing in this passage draws on personal experiences to help infer meaning. 

// quote origin: Richard F. Shepard, "Despite the Heat Summer in the City Has Always Been An Outdoor Affair," New York Times, July 8, 1990 
Using the context clue provided, what is the most accurate definition of the word in bold? <p>Water and ice go to extremes in <strong>estival</strong> New York. Water consumption in summer averages 1.6 billion gallons a day, as against 1.2 billion in winter.</p>
1. pertaining or appropriate to summer*
~feedback: That's correct. You can infer from the adjacent sentence that this passage is referring to water consumption in summer, so it's a safe bet that <strong>estival</strong> has something to do with summer. 
2. Thirst or thirstiness
~feedback: That's not correct. Though the second sentence does deal with water consumption, it's clearly making a comparison between two seasons, winter and summer. 
3. Non-free festival
~feedback: That's not correct. Though the word may have a similar root to "festival," nothing in this passage suggests any connection to festivals or their cost. 

Using the context clue provided, what is the most accurate definition of the word in bold? <p>Adults born in the 1980s have almost a <strong>prelapsarian</strong> nostalgia for the <em>Oregon Trail</em> game, with it's straight-forward game play and its association with elementary school. </p>
1. characteristic of or pertaining to any innocent or carefree period* 
~feedback: That's correct. This passage uses examples of personal experience to provide context for the word <strong>prelapsarian.</strong>
2. Scholarly or based on academic work
~feedback: That's not correct. Though <em>Oregon Trail</em> is associated with school, this passage isn't about its relationship to academia. 
3. Pre-running stretching exercises
~feedback: That's not correct. The root of this word is "lapse," not "lap," so it has nothing to do with running. 

## 1.3 Evaluate strategies for retaining new words

### 1.3.1 Identify strategies for using context clues

~file: context_clues_practice2

Based on what you learned in the last section, what is the correct definition of <strong>voracious</strong>?
1. exceedingly eager or avid.*
~feedback: That's correct. This passage is encouraging you to read more often and more enthusiastically. 
2. Thankful or exceedingly humble
~feedback: That's not correct. This passage has nothing to do with being thankful or humble, even though the word sounds similar to "gracious."
3. Aloud or out loud
~feedback: That's not correct. This passage doesn't tell you whether to read aloud or silently: it's just suggesting that you read more. 

### 1.3.2 Evaluate strategies for retaining new words

~file: retain_words_practice

Which of the following is a good strategy to retain new words?
1. Write them down in a personal lexicon.*
~feedback: That's correct. Recording a word will help you come back to it later. 
2. Use them in your next history paper.
~feedback: While this might help you remember the word, it might not be appropriate for every paper. Don't use big words just for the sake of using them. 
3. Create flashcards with the definitions. 
~feedback: Drill-based memorization methods are not as effective as actually using the words in context. 

Which of the following words is not based on the Latin root "brev" (meaning brief or short)?
1. Abbreviate
~feedback: That's incorrect. To abbreviate means to shorten a word or phrase. 
2. Brevity 
~feedback: That's incorrect. Brevity is the state of being short, or brief. 
3. Bravado* 
~feedback: Correct. Though "bravado" sounds similar to the "brev" root, it has a different origin. Bravado means "a bold manner or a show of boldness intended to impress or intimidate."

What is the meaning of the word "antithesis," based on the Latin root "anti" (against) and the Greek root "the" (position)?
1. A proposition that is the diametric opposite of some other proposition.*
~feedback: That's correct. The literal meaning is the opposite of the position. 
2. The state of being opposed to a certain location.
~feedback: That's incorrect. Position in this case is rhetorical rather than physical. 
3. A statement that doesn't make a claim. 
~feedback: That's incorrect. "Anti" doesn't mean "lack of"-- the root for that is "a" or "an." 

# 2 Recognize and evaluate strategies for moving beyond the five-paragraph essay

## 2.1 Recognize characteristics of organically-structured essays.

### 2.1.1 Differentiate between formulaic and organic structure.

// Module: Beyond the five paragraph essay

~file: organic_essays_practice1

Which of the following represents an organic thesis?
1. The federal tax code is extremely complicated.
~feedback. Incorrect. This is a statement of fact rather than an arguable thesis.
2. The federal tax code is complicated because of deductions, exemptions, and arcane rules.
~feedback. Incorrect. This is a statement of fact and sets up a map for a five-paragraph essay.
3. The Graduated Corporate Income Tax has outlived its usefulness.*
~feedback. Correct. This thesis is a focused, arguable statement that is nuanced and intriguing. 

Which of the following represents an organic structure?
1. In arguing that the Graduated Corporate Income Tax has outlived its usefulness, the writer first provides a history of the tax, then presents several case studies showing the effect of the tax on different corporations. The writer then moves to a discussion of why some corporations support the tax, followed by an analysis of how that tax support is flawed. Finally the writer calls for repeal of the tax.*
~feedback. Correct. In this structure, the ideas in the paragraphs build on one another rather than following a formula. 
2. In arguing that the Graduated Corporate Income Tax has outlived its usefulness, the writer organizes the body of the paper with three paragraphs, each devoted to a separate reason why the tax has outlived its usefulness.
~feedback. Incorrect. This writer is imposing the basic five-paragraph structure on his or her argument.
3. In arguing that the Graduated Corporate Income Tax has outlived its usefulness, the writer states his or her thesis at the end of the introduction; organizes the body of the paper with four paragraphs, each devoted to a separate reason why the tax has outlived its usefulness; and uses the introduction and conclusion to state and restate his or her thesis.
~feedback. Incorrect. This writer is following the formula of the five-paragraph essay, even though the paper has four body paragraphs.

Which of the following represents an organic structure for introductions and conclusions?
1. The writer states that the Graduated Corporate Income Tax has outlived its usefulness in the introduction and then restates the idea in the conclusion using the same words.
~feedback. Incorrect. This writer is following the repetitive formula of the five-paragraph essay.
2. The writer states that the Graduated Corporate Income Tax has outlived its usefulness in the introduction and then uses the conclusion to show how keeping outdated parts of the tax code in place damages the efficiency of U.S. Treasury processes.*
~feedback. Correct. Here the writer uses the conclusion to show the broader implications of the paper's thesis.
3. The writer states that the Graduated Corporate Income Tax has outlived its usefulness in the introduction and then restates that idea in the conclusion using different words. 
~feedback. Incorrect. This writer is following the repetitive formula of the five-paragraph essay even though he or she is changing the words.

### 2.1.2 Identify characteristics of organically-structured essays.

~file: organic_essays_practice2

Which of the following is not a characteristic of an organically-structured essay?
1. A nuanced, arguable, original thesis statement.
~feedback: Incorrect. This is a characteristic of an organically-structured essay.
2. A conclusion that solely restates the thesis.*
~feedback: Correct. In an organically-structured essay, the conclusion offers broader implications for the thesis.
3. Body paragraphs in which the ideas build on one another.
~feedback: Incorrect. This is a characteristic of an organically-structured essay.

Which of the following strategies might characterize the process of writing an organically-structured essay?
1. Doubting some of the points he or she is making while writing the essay, the writer decides to stop writing and read further to learn more.*
~feedback: Correct. Writers of organically-structured essays use writing and additional reading to learn more and to refine their thinking.
2. The writer decides every point he or she will make before writing a word.
~feedback: Incorrect. Writers of organically-structured essays use writing, and additional reading, to learn more and to refine their thinking.
3. The writer decides not to offer any original ideas in the paper but rely solely on the information that was discussed in class or the textbook.
~feedback: Incorrect. Writers of organically-structured essays use writing and additional reading to refine their thinking and advocate for their own ideas.

Paragraphs in an organically-structured essay should:
1. Build on one another, moving the reader through a logical chain of reasoning.*
~feedback: Correct. Writers of organically-structured essays let the content of the paper determine the organization of the paragraphs.
2. Repeat the same structure so the reader does not get confused.
~feedback: Incorrect. Writers of organically-structured essays let the content of each paragraph determine the structure.
3. Be restricted to a definite number such as three, five, or seven.
~feedback: Incorrect. Writers of organically-structured essays use as many paragraphs as are necessary to fully develop their ideas.

## 2.2 Recognize and evaluate effective paragraphs

### 2.2.1 Recognize techniques for effective paragraph construction

~file: recognize_paragraphs_practice1

Which sentence is the topic, or key, sentence in this paragraph? 
1. The phenomenon of red-eye can be lessened by using the red-eye reduction feature found on many SLR cameras.*
~feedback: Correct. The topic sentence is not always at the beginning of a paragraph. In this case, the topic sentence is closer to the middle of the paragraph. The first two sentences provide background and buildup for the topic sentence. 
2. When a camera flash is used in a low-light environment, the subject's eyes may appear red in the finished photograph.
~feedback: That's not correct. The topic sentence is not always at the beginning of a paragraph. In this case, the topic sentence is closer to the middle of the paragraph. The first two sentences provide background and buildup for the topic sentence. 
3. Since a smaller pupil means a smaller host for the reflection, the chances of red-eye occurring are greatly reduced.
~feedback: That's not correct. The last sentences of this paragraph provide support for the topic sentence, which occurs closer to the middle. 

### 2.2.1 Recognize techniques for effective paragraph construction

~file: recognize_paragraphs_practice2

From the organizational schemes you learned in this section, which one best fits this paragraph? 
1. Spatial*
~feedback: Correct: Julius Caesar is describing the geography of Gaul. He structures his description based on the location of river and landforms and how they divide different groups of inhabitants. 
2. Chronological
~feedback: That's not correct. Julius Caesar is describing the geography of Gaul. He structures his description based on the location of river and landforms and how they divide different groups of inhabitants. He doesn't establish a timeline or sequence of events in this paragraph. 
3. Rank Order
~feedback: That's not correct. Julius Caesar is describing the geography of Gaul. He structures his description based on the location of rivers and landforms and how they divide different groups of inhabitants. Though he does classify these inhabitants ("the bravest"), the paragraph is still organized based on the physical layout of Gaul. 

### 2.2.2 Evaluate paragraph construction

~file: revise_paragraphs_practice

Kate wrote the paragraph below in her paper about technology use among children. What revision advice would you give her? <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Furthermore, there are some negative impacts of the electronic revolution in our daily lives, especially in the lives of our children. Children are our future and it is important that we raise them well. These days iPhones and smartphones are affordable which has made it relatively easy for our children to gain access to all kinds of social media websites that either expose them to dangers or negative influences that impact their social life and more importantly their education.</p>
1. Kate should remove or revise the sentence "Children are our future and it is important that we raise them well" because it is a digression that interrupts the logical flow of the paragraph.*
~feedback: Correct. This sentence is out of place. It might fit elsewhere in Kate's paper (like her conclusion), but it doesn't fit here.
2. Kate should list other types of smartphones in order to be more specific and detailed in her description. 
~feedback: That's incorrect. In some cases, it makes sense to be more specific. But adding a list of smartphone brands would not add anything to this paragraph. It would distract from Kate's main point. 
3. Kate should write "there are some negative and positive impacts" in the first sentence so she is giving equal consideration to other viewpoints. 
~feedback: That's incorrect. This paragraph is specifically about negative impacts; though there may be positive impacts, it would be out of place to discuss them here.

A store refund may be, for example: a cash refund, a store credit, or a gift card.
1. No *
~feedback: Correct. A comma is the better choice for a short series or list. Normally, "for example" lists just a couple examples (a couple as an example of the larger list.) 
2. Yes
~feedback: Incorrect. A comma is the better choice for a short series or list. Normally, "for example" lists just a couple examples (a couple as an example of the larger list.) 

A store may charge a restocking fee in the following circumstances: (1) if the item is removed from plastic wrapping, (2) if the box is torn, (3) if tags or labels have been removed from the item.
1. Yes*
~feedback: Correct. A colon is used before a list. However, the initial word of the list item is lowercase if it is not a complete sentence.
2. No
~feedback: Incorrect. A colon is used before a list. However, the initial word of the list item is lowercase if it is not a complete sentence.

If a store's policy differs from the state-wide, seven-day policy, then the store must: place a written notice about their policies, in language that consumers can understand, so that it can be easily seen and read.
1. No*
~feedback: Correct. No colon is used here because the part following the colon is neither an explanation nor a list; it is the completion of the central idea of the sentence. (No commas should be used either.) 
2. Yes
~feedback: Incorrect. No colon is used here because the part following the colon is neither an explanation nor a list; it is the completion of the central idea of the sentence. (No commas should be used either.) 

California law is very exact about posting store policy: The policy must be displayed either at each entrance to the store, at each cash register and sales counter, on tags attached to each item, or on the company's order forms, if any.
1. Yes*
~feedback: Correct. A colon is used before a second clause which explains or illustrates the first clause. 
2. No
~feedback: Incorrect A colon is used before a second clause which explains or illustrates the first clause.

Which of the sentences are run-ons? Identify them based on their number. 
1. 3, 4 *
~feedback: Correct. Sentence 3 needs a comma inserted before the word "and": Apparently we were wizards, and the law was cracking down on magic. Sentence 4 is also a run-on sentence: a comma should appear before "but."
2. 1, 2, 5
~feedback: That's not right. All three sentences are technically correct, even though the "But" at the start of sentence 5 is unnecessary, and it could be removed without affecting the meaning of the sentence.
3. All the sentences are run-ons.
~feedback: That's incorrect. Look at the difference between sentences 1 and 3. 
4. None of the sentences are run-ons. 
~feedback: That's incorrect. Look at the difference between sentences 1 and 3.

What is Stallman's main claim in the article? 
1. Online education should avoid using the open but non-free licenses CC-BY-NC and CC-BY-NC-SA because they take control away from student and educator users and they are difficult to apply to educational content. *
~feedback: Correct. Stallman states in the first paragraph that "For works that might be useful in commercial contexts, the requisite freedom includes commercial use, redistribution and modification." The rest of the article is comprised of evidence and reasons why educators should not use these particular licenses in their work. 
2. Online education should not use Creative Commons licenses because some CC licenses are non-free. 
~feedback: That's not correct. Stallman is not arguing against all Creative Commons licenses. In fact, he licensed this article with one. He is specifically targeting BY-NC licenses. The evidence used in the article does not attempt to discourage CC licenses in general. This would be a very different argument, and would use different kinds of support. 
3. Online education should use GNU licenses instead of Creative Commons licenses. 
~feedback: That's not correct. Though Stallman, as the founder of the GNU movement, would probably like people to use GNU licenses instead of CC licenses, this article is not fighting that fight. Stallman is arguing specifically for avoiding BY-NC licenses and articulating domain-restricted reasons why. 

Using only the context of the article itself, what statements can you make about Stallman's intended audience? 
1. Stallman's audience includes readers with familiarity with online education and open educational content. The audience is probably also familiar with Creative Commons licenses and has heard of concepts like "open source" and "copyleft," They are primarily producers of content. * 
~feedback: That's correct. Stallman jumps right into his argument in this article. He does not take time to define terms or provide context. Thus, we can assume that his intended audience has familiarity with this content domain. Though he provides hyperlinks to further explanations of some terms, the argument itself proceeds without explicit confirmation that the audience knows what the terms mean. 
2. Stallman's audience includes teachers and students with an interest in online education. They are primarily consumers of content. 
~feedback: That's not correct. Most of the language of this article is targeted at an audience involved in the production and dissemination of content. A basic user (teacher or student) of open educational content would likely be confused by the second person "you" in this article, given that their purpose is primarily consumption of content rather than production. 
3. Stallman's audience is primarily software developers in the open-source movement. This audience comes is familiar with software licensing systems but has little to no experience with disseminating open educational resources. 
~feedback: That's not correct. Though you are right that Stallman's overall audience is usually developers and academics in the open-source software movement, there is very little content in this article that is domain-specific to software developers. Given that CC licenses are not used frequently with software projects, Stallman's assumption that his audience is familiar with the CC license framework suggests that this article in particular is not primarily targeted at software developers (they may be a secondary audience). 

### 4.3.2 Apply different types of analytic processes 

~file: types_analysis_practice2

Is this assignment asking for descriptive analysis or prescriptive analysis? 
1. Descriptive analysis*
~feedback: Correct. Even though the assignment does ask the writer to issue recommendations, the context of the analysis is exploratory. It is not a proposal, which would more likely include prescriptive analysis. 
2. Prescriptive analysis 
~feedback: That's incorrect. Even though the assignment does ask the writer to issue recommendations, the context of the analysis is exploratory. It is not a proposal, which would more likely include prescriptive analysis. 

Joanne wrote the following when she was brainstorming how to get started on this assignment: <p style="padding-left: 30px;"> I really feel like the Chick-fil-A line in the Union is inefficient. Dining services knows that Chick-fil-A is the most popular lunch choice on campus, so why is the line so slow? Surely this process could be improved with a little common sense. I think I want to write about this, but I'm not sure where to start. Hmmm…</p> Which is the best approach to writing this paper? 
1. Joanne should observe the process on at least three separate occasion and keep detailed notes in her journal. She should analyze her observations and gather quantitative data about the number of people served in line and formulate an initial thesis. She can use this thesis to frame the rest of her process analysis. *
~feedback: Correct. Joanne has a hunch about the Chick-fil-A line, but she can't know if her hunch is valid without data. The most important part of a process analysis is to assemble a complete picture of the process itself. Sometimes this can involve observation or study before the drafting of the essay can even begin. 
2. Joanne should gather academic sources about the history of fast food restaurants and study the marketing materials from Chick-fil-A. She should build a thesis about how the line should function based on historical research and guidelines from the company. 
~feedback: That's incorrect. Though Joanne might end up with a good research paper or proposal following this method, she won't have a process analysis. The most important part of a process analysis is to assemble a complete picture of the process itself. Sometimes this can involve observation or study before the drafting of the essay can even begin. 
3. Joanne should interview her classmates about their experiences with the Chick-fil-A line and contact her friends at other schools to find out how their Chick-fil-A lines work. Then she can begin drafting an essay about how to improve the line based on the statements given by her interviewees.
~feedback: That's incorrect. Though this kind of research is useful in other types of writing projects, it isn't helpful for a process analysis. The most important part of a process analysis is to assemble a complete picture of the process itself. Sometimes this can involve observation or study before the drafting of the essay can even begin.

Mae Belle knows that to write a successful critical analysis she first has to write a successful description. Which of the following is a logical way for her to organize her description of the Lucky Strikes ad? 
1. She should begin her description by explaining what the ad is selling and contextualizing the time period. Then, she should follow a physical description of the ad, commenting on colors, typography, and arrangement, generally moving from the top left to the bottom right.*
~feedback: That's correct. The best way to describe an ad or other visual artifact is to provide as much realistic detail as possible organized in a way that corresponds to the way a viewer would perceive the ad itself. 
2. She should begin her description by commenting on the false ethos established by the doctor in the ad recommending cigarettes. She should also note the prevalence of the word "toasted," which can be associated with hearty food. 
~feedback: That's incorrect. These sentences start to analyze the ad. If Mae Belle is trying to describe the ad first, she shouldn't get into the meaning of each part. The best way to describe an ad or other visual artifact is to provide as much realistic detail as possible organized in a way that corresponds to the way a viewer would perceive the ad itself. 
3. She should begin her description by explaining the history of cigarette advertising in the U.S. and rely on research sources to contextualize the Lucky Strike brand. She should then describe the ad's relationship to other cigarette brand ads of the time period.
~feedback: That's incorrect. Though this might make an interesting paper, if Mae Belle's purpose is to write a critical analysis and to begin with a description of the ad, she's off on the wrong foot. A description should focus on what's taking place within the ad. The best way to describe an ad or other visual artifact is to provide as much realistic detail as possible organized in a way that corresponds to the way a viewer would perceive the ad itself. 

Iola tells Mae Belle not to use a "part by part" organization for her critical analysis because it doesn't fit this kind of artifact. Is she right?
1. No*
~feedback: Correct. A part-by-part organization for an analysis of this ad might focus on different visual components of the ad one at a time: a section on the typography, a section on the colors, a section on the characters, and a section on the placement of the brand. 
2. Yes
~feedback: Incorrect. A part-by-part organization for an analysis of this ad might focus on different visual components of the ad one at a time: a section on the typography, a section on the colors, a section on the characters, and a section on the placement of the brand.

How does this video about vehicle safety features appeal to logos? 
1. The specific details about the safety features of the car reveal a focus on logos.*

Based on this map, which of the following statements is factually correct?
1. Texas and California had the most crimes committed in 2004.*
~feedback: That's correct. The map accurately displays the data with California and Texas having the darkest shades of red.
2. Texas had a higher number of crimes than california in 2004.
~feedback: That's incorrect. We don't have any way of knowing that from this map because actual numbers of crime per state are not included.
3. California is extremely dangerous.
~feedback: That's incorrect. This map does not make that claim, and if you were to use this map in support of your own claim, you would need more statistical evidence. 

Claude wants to use this map as evidence to show that crime rates are very high in California and Texas. Is this a valid use of the data?
1. No.*
~feedback: That's correct. This map shows total number of crimes, not crime rates. Without knowing the population of these states, we cannot extrapolate the crime rate from this map without additional data.
2. Yes.
~feedback: That's incorrect. This map shows total number of crimes, not crime rates. Without knowing the population of these states, we cannot extrapolate the crime rate from this map without additional data.

Is this map itself a manipulative appeal to logos?
1. No.*
~feedback: That's correct. Data itself cannot be manipulative, and the map accurately represents the data about total number of crimes. This map could be used to make a manipulative appeal to logos.
2. Yes
~feedback: That's incorrect. Data itself cannot be manipulative, and the map accurately represents the data about total number of crimes. This map could be used to make a manipulative appeal to logos.

Who is likely part of the intended audience for this argument? 
1. Residents of South Carolina who take pride in symbols of the Confederacy
~feedback: Consider re-reading the text. In this passage, Obama directly addresses the issues of gun control, continuing racial inequality, and demands that South Carolina remove the Confederate flag from the state capitol. 
2. U.S. citizens who are concerned about gun violence but believe laws restricting gun ownership are unconstitutional
~feedback: Consider re-reading the text. In this passage, Obama directly addresses the issues of gun control, continuing racial inequality, and demands that South Carolina remove the Confederate flag from the state capitol. 
3. U.S. citizens who believe racial inequality was ended during the civil rights movement
~feedback: Consider re-reading the text. In this passage, Obama directly addresses the issues of gun control, continuing racial inequality, and demands that South Carolina remove the Confederate flag from the state capitol. 
4. All of these. *
~feedback: Correct! In this passage, Obama directly addresses the issues of gun control, continuing racial inequality, and demands that South Carolina remove the Confederate flag from the state capitol. 

Who is the president's intended audience for this statement? <p>"We don't earn grace. We're all sinners. We don't deserve it. But God gives it to us anyway."</p>
1. People who wonder about the sources of continued racial prejudice
2. People who believe in God or identify as Christian*

Who might be included in President Obama's unintended potential audience? Unintended audiences are those who aren't directly addressed by the content of the argument, as well as those who hold points of view that the author of an argument hasn't considered carefully or at least mentioned in passing.
1. People who think getting rid of religion altogether would help to improve society*
~feedback: Correct! Throughout his speech, President Obama makes claims grounded in the presumption that Christian spirituality is a positive force for social change. 
2. People who believe the only way to stop gun violence is to repeal the Second Amendment
~feedback: Consider re-reading the text. President Obama's claim that the "vast majority of Americans" think something should be done to stop gun violence contains an implicit admission that some people do not think of gun violence as a problem that needs to be addressed. Similarly, his claim that, "[w]hatever solutions we find will necessarily be incomplete," implicitly addresses those people who do not believe that gun control legislation would be sufficient to address the problem of gun violence, but instead see repeal of the Second Amendment as the only real solution. Finally, when President Obama explicitly mentions "the majority of gun owners" who "want to do something about this," he is acknowledging those members of his audience who may think all gun owners are or should be against gun control legislation.

Read the statements below carefully. Which describes one of President Obama's intended audiences?
1. They do not respect Christian beliefs about God and divine grace.
~feedback: That's not correct. Clearly the president's speech assumes religious common ground with his audience. 
2. They are not aware of the history of American democracy and the civil rights movement.
~feedback. That's not correct. Obama knows that his audience is familiar with the civil rights movement and makes many references to it. 
3. They believe the Confederate flag is a symbol of integrity and justified rebellion against an oppressive government.*
~feedback: Correct! President Obama is clearly addressing those who share his own beliefs and values. He is also, though, hoping to persuade those who may disagree with him, such as citizens who believe the Confederate flag is a symbol of integrity and justified rebellion against an oppressive government.

1. Print Source: Even though the newspaper can be accessed online, it is still published in print form, and follows the conventions of a print newspaper. *
~feedback: That's correct. <em>The Washington Post</em> is considered a credible, well-respected newspaper, and would generally be categorized as a print source. Keep in mind that some parts of the <em>Post's</em> website are more problematic, like blogs and interactive media content. 
2. Online Source: Because the source is viewed on a webpage, it's always considered an online source, regardless of the medium of original publication. 
~feedback: That's incorrect. Just because you accessed the source online does not mean it was originally online. <em>The Washington Post</em> has been publishing since long before the internet, and it adheres to the conventions of a traditional print newspaper. Most content from its website should be considered a "print" source. 
3. Print Source: Because all news sources, whether accessed online or not, are considered print sources. 
~feedback: That's incorrect. Many online news sources, like <em>The Drudge Report</em> or <em>Buzzfeed</em> publish online only. Though they may be good sources to use in some contexts, they cannot be considered "print" sources because they adhere to different publishing conventions. 

True or False: You should never use information you found on Wikipedia in a research project. 
1. False.*
~feedback: That's correct. You may have been warned of the evils of Wikipedia (or other online sources) in the past, but all sources have an appropriate context. There is nothing inherently wrong or right about Wikipedia: like any other online source, you have to evaluate it for credibility and reliability before you decide if you can use it.

What is a good indicator that an online source has authority in a particular area?
1. The source has a formal degree in a subject area.*
~feedback: Correct. Sources with strong authority are often highly educated in their fields, and many may even have advanced degrees.
2. The source uses long words.
~feedback: Incorrect. Though technical and complicated language might indicate authority, it does not guarantee that someone is a strong authority in an area.
3. The website looks professional.
~feedback: Incorrect. The look of the website does not necessarily correlate to the source's credentials to write or speak on a topic. 



~file: apply_online_practice_2

Which of the following is a reason you might question the accuracy of an online source?
1. You cannot verify the information with any other sources.*
~feedback: Correct. This doesn't necessarily mean the information isn't accurate; however, you probably want to at least question why no other sources have the same or similar information.
2. The website doesn't look professional.
~feedback: Incorrect. The looks of a website might matter to some people, but an ugly site doesn't mean the information contained on it is inaccurate.
3. The source cites others in the same field.
~feedback: Incorrect. Experts in an area often cite others in the field to demonstrate their knowledge of the material.

You are researching your paper on experimental cancer treatments when you find a website from a company which is introducing a new drug. From the website it is clear that the company has three well-known oncologists working for them. One of those doctors has a quotation praising the new drug, and you like the wording. Which of the following best describes how you should evaluate this source?
1. You should look for more objective source information about the drug and use it.*
~feedback: Correct. It is problematic that the doctor works for the company, and your readers might have a problem with the potential bias.
2. You should use the source information. Oncologists are highly-trained specialists and have a great deal of authority.
~feedback: Incorrect. While it is true that oncologists are highly reliable authorities on cancer treatments, this particular doctor is paid by the drug company, which is a potential conflict of interest and presents a problem with bias.
3. You should not use the source because information on cancer and other diseases should only come from credible hospital websites.
~feedback: Incorrect. Credible information can come from plenty of different places. In this case, the problem with the source is the potential bias since the doctor is employed by the drug company.

Choose the best paraphrase
1. In the United States, the education system places too much emphasis on formal testing, overlooking the limitations and expenses imposed when that assessment strategy is employed exclusively (Gardner 179).*
~feedback: Correct. This paraphrase is different enough from the original source that it would not be considered plagiarism, so long as Gardner is credited.
2. America has now gone too far toward formal testing, without realizing the costs and limitations of exclusively emphasizing that approach (Gardner 179).
~feedback: That's incorrect. Although the source is cited, the paraphrasing is too close to the original statement as it retained too much of the original wording and sentence structure.
