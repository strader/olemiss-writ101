A store refund may be, for example: a cash refund, a store credit, or a gift card.
1. No *
~feedback: Correct. A comma is the better choice for a short series or list. Normally, “for example” lists just a couple examples (a couple as an example of the larger list.)

A store may charge a restocking fee in the following circumstances: (1) If the item is removed from plastic wrapping, (2) If the box is torn, (3) If tags or labels have been removed from the item.
1. Yes*
~feedback: Correct. A colon is used before a list. However, the initial word of the list item is lowercase if it is not a complete sentence.
2. No
~feedback: Incorrect. A colon is used before a list. However, the initial word of the list item is lowercase if it is not a complete sentence.

If a store’s policy differs from the state-wide, seven-day policy, then the store must: place a written notice about their policies, in language that consumers can understand, so that it can be easily seen and read.
1. No*
~feedback: Correct. No colon is used here because the part following the colon is neither an explanation nor a list; it is the completion of the central idea of the sentence. (No commas should be used either.) 
2. Yes
~feedback: Incorrect. No colon is used here because the part following the colon is neither an explanation nor a list; it is the completion of the central idea of the sentence. (No commas should be used either.) 

California law is very exact about posting store policy: The policy must be displayed either at each entrance to the store, at each cash register and sales counter, on tags attached to each item, or on the company’s order forms, if any.
1. Yes*
~feedback: Correct. A colon is used before a second clause which explains or illustrates the first clause. Incorrect initial capital after the colon.
2. No
~feedback: Incorrect A colon is used before a second clause which explains or illustrates the first clause. Incorrect initial capital after the colon.

Which of the sentences are run-ons? Identify them based on their number. 
1. 3, 4 *
~feedback: Correct. Sentence 3 needs a comma inserted before the word “and”: Apparently we were wizards, and the law was cracking down on magic. Sentence 4 is also a run-on sentence: While “So” at the beginning of the sentence is technically fine, it’s unnecessary.
2. 1, 2, 5
~feedback: That’s not right. All three sentences are technically correct, even though the “But” at the start of sentence 5 is unnecessary, and it could be removed without affecting the meaning of the sentence.
3. All the sentences are fragments.
~feedback: That’s incorrect. Look at the difference between sentences 1 and 3. 
4. None of the sentences are fragments. 
~feedback: That’s incorrect. Look at the difference between sentences 1 and 3.

~feedback: Correct. This is a reasonable, debatable, supportable, focused claim.
3. Students who cheat in online courses are immoral.
~feedback: Incorrect. This is a value-based statement that cannot be proven with evidence.
4. Cheating has been around for many years.
~feedback: Incorrect. This statement does not take a position or make an assertion.

Which of the following is an argumentative thesis?
1. Homelessness is a problem for southern cities.

6. Ad hominem
~feedback: Incorrect.  Think about the relationship between saying goodnight and falling asleep.  Does one cause the other?
7. Slippery Slope
~feedback: Incorrect.  Remember that slippery slope implies a chain reaction of multiple events.  Focus on the word ‘because’ in this sentence.  Which of these fallacies deals with causation?

~dropdown2
1. Begging the Question
~feedback: Incorrect.  What’s the implication of the phrase ‘shared widely’ in this passage?

Who is likely part of the intended audience for this argument? 
1. Residents of South Carolina who take pride in symbols of the Confederacy
~feedback: Consider re-reading the text. In this passage, Obama directly addresses the issues of gun control, continuing racial inequality, and demands that South Carolina remove the Confederate flag from the state capitol. 
2. U.S. citizens who are concerned about gun violence but believe laws restricting gun ownership are unconstitutional
~feedback: Consider re-reading the text. In this passage, Obama directly addresses the issues of gun control, continuing racial inequality, and demands that South Carolina remove the Confederate flag from the state capitol. 
3. U.S. citizens who believe racial inequality was ended during the civil rights movement
~feedback: Consider re-reading the text. In this passage, Obama directly addresses the issues of gun control, continuing racial inequality, and demands that South Carolina remove the Confederate flag from the state capitol. 
4. All of these. *
~feedback: Correct! In this passage, Obama directly addresses the issues of gun control, continuing racial inequality, and demands that South Carolina remove the Confederate flag from the state capitol. 

Who is the president’s intended audience for this statement? <p>”We don’t earn grace. We’re all sinners. We don’t deserve it. But God gives it to us anyway.”</p>
1. People who wonder about the sources of continued racial prejudice
2. People who believe in God or identify as Christian* 
3. People who are impatient for change

Who is the president’s intended audience for this statement? <p>"Perhaps it causes us to examine what we’re doing to cause some of our children to hate."</p>
1. People who wonder about the sources of continued racial prejudice*
2. People who believe in God or identify as Christian 
3. People who are impatient for change

Who is the president’s intended audience for this statement?<p>"None of us can or should expect a transformation in race relations overnight."</p>
1. People who wonder about the sources of continued racial prejudice
2. People who believe in God or identify as Christian
3. People who are impatient for change*

Who might be included in President Obama's unintended potential audience? Unintended audiences are those who aren't directly addressed by the content of the argument, as well as those who hold points of view that the author of an argument hasn't considered carefully or at least mentioned in passing.
1. People who think getting rid of religion altogether would help to improve society*
~feedback: Correct! Throughout his speech, President Obama makes claims grounded in the presumption that Christian spirituality is a positive force for social change. 
2. People who believe the only way to stop gun violence is to repeal the Second Amendment
~feedback: Consider re-reading the text. President Obama's claim that the "vast majority of Americans" think something should be done to stop gun violence contains an implicit admission that some people do not think of gun violence as a problem that needs to be addressed. Similarly, his claim that, "[w]hatever solutions we find will necessarily be incomplete," implicitly addresses those people who do not believe that gun control legislation would be sufficient to address the problem of gun violence, but instead see repeal of the Second Amendment as the only real solution. Finally, when President Obama explicitly mentions "the majority of gun owners" who "want to do something about this," he is acknowledging those members of his audience who may think all gun owners are or should be against gun control legislation.
3. People who think gun owners are against gun control legislation

~feedback: Consider re-reading the text. President Obama's claim that the "vast majority of Americans" think something should be done to stop gun violence contains an implicit admission that some people do not think of gun violence as a problem that needs to be addressed. Similarly, his claim that, "[w]hatever solutions we find will necessarily be incomplete," implicitly addresses those people who do not believe that gun control legislation would be sufficient to address the problem of gun violence, but instead see repeal of the Second Amendment as the only real solution. Finally, when President Obama explicitly mentions "the majority of gun owners" who "want to do something about this," he is acknowledging those members of his audience who may think all gun owners are or should be against gun control legislation.

Read the statements below carefully. Which describes one of President Obama’s intended audiences?
1. They do not respect Christian beliefs about God and divine grace.
~feedback: That’s not correct. Clearly the president’s speech assumes religious common ground with his audience. 
2. They are not aware of the history of American democracy and the civil rights movement.
~feedback. That’s not correct. Obama knows that his audience is familiar with the civil rights movement and makes many references to it. 
3. They believe the Confederate flag is a symbol of integrity and justified rebellion against an oppressive government.*
~feedback: Correct! President Obama is clearly addressing those who share his own beliefs and values. He is also, though, hoping to persuade those who may disagree with him, such as citizens who believe the Confederate flag is a symbol of integrity and justified rebellion against an oppressive government.

1. Print Source: Even though the newspaper can be accessed online, it is still published in print form, and follows the conventions of a print newspaper. *
~feedback: That’s correct. <em>The Washington Post</em> is considered a credible, well-respected newspaper, and would generally be categorized as a print source. Keep in mind that some parts of the <em>Post’s</em> website are more problematic, like blogs and interactive media content. 
2. Online Source: Because the source is viewed on a webpage, it’s always considered an online source, regardless of the medium of original publication. 
~feedback: That’s incorrect. Just because you accessed the source online does not mean it was originally online. <em>The Washington Post</em> has been publishing since long before the internet, and it adheres to the conventions of a traditional print newspaper. Most content from its website should be considered a “print” source. 
3. Print Source: Because all news sources, whether accessed online or not, are considered print sources. 
~feedback: That’s incorrect. Many online news sources, like <em>The Drudge Report</em> or <em>Buzzfeed</em> publish online only. Though they may be good sources to use in some contexts, they cannot be considered “print” sources because they adhere to different publishing conventions. 

True or False: You should never use information you found on Wikipedia in a research project. 
1. False.*
~feedback: That’s correct. You may have been warned of the evils of Wikipedia (or other online sources) in the past, but all sources have an appropriate context. There is nothing inherently wrong or right about Wikipedia: like any other online source, you have to evaluate it for credibility and reliability before you decide if you can use it.

Elaine finds a <em>New York Times</em> article about Mary Barra being named as General Motors’ chief executive in 2016. She also finds a <em>Wall Street Journal</em>article that says The <em>New York Times</em> article misrepresented Barra’s title as “chairwoman” when her actual title is “chairman.” This makes Elaine question the accuracy of The <em>New York Times</em> article. She double-checks The <em>New York Times</em> article to see if the writer or editor explains the use of “chairwoman” and finds no explanation. She checks several sources that refer to Barra as “chairman” and finds Barra’s Twitter feed where Barra refers to herself as “chairman.” She decides the <em>New York Times</em> article is inaccurate and looks for an alternative source.

What is a good indicator that an online source has authority in a particular area?
1. The source has a formal degree in a subject area.*
~feedback: Correct. Sources with strong authority are often highly educated in their fields, and many may even have advanced degrees.
2. The source uses long words.
~feedback: Incorrect. Though technical and complicated language might indicate authority, it does not guarantee that someone is a strong authority in an area.
3. The website looks professional.
~feedback: Incorrect. The look of the website does not necessarily correlate to the source’s credentials to write or speak on a topic.

Which of the following is a reason you might question the accuracy of an online source?
1. You cannot verify the information with any other sources.*
~feedback: Correct. This doesn’t necessarily mean the information isn’t accurate; however, you probably want to at least question why no other sources have the same or similar information.
2. The website doesn’t look professional.
~feedback: Incorrect. The looks of a website might matter to some people, but an ugly site doesn’t mean the information contained on it is inaccurate.
3. The source cites others in the same field.
~feedback: Incorrect. Experts in an area often cite others in the field to demonstrate their knowledge of the material.

You are researching your paper on experimental cancer treatments when you find a website from a company which is introducing a new drug. From the website it is clear that the company has three well-known oncologists working for them. One of those doctors has a quotation praising the new drug, and you like the wording. Which of the following best describes how you should evaluate this source?
1. You should look for more objective source information about the drug and use it.*
~feedback: Correct. It is problematic that the doctor works for the company, and your readers might have a problem with the potential bias.
2. You should use the source information. Oncologists are highly-trained specialists and have a great deal of authority.
~feedback: Incorrect. While it is true that oncologists are highly reliable authorities on cancer treatments, this particular doctor is paid by the drug company, which is a potential conflict of interest and presents a problem with bias.
3. You should not use the source because information on cancer and other diseases should only come from credible hospital websites.
~feedback: Incorrect. Credible information can come from plenty of different places. In this case, the problem with the source is the potential bias since the doctor is employed by the drug company.

3. The changes have resulted in more focus on academics and extracurricular activities at Coleman, which has made parents in the district happy.
~feedback: Incorrect. Here the writer is summarizing the source previously introduced. 

Which part of the passage explains the relevance of the source to the writer’s thesis? 
1. In fact, many parents have switched their thinking from once believing punitive measures are necessary to modify children’s behaviors to now seeing reflective practices as meaningful alternatives to detention. *
~feedback: Correct. In this concluding sentence, the writer explains how the example is relevant to her thesis.
2. Administrators at the school claim to have seen a marked improvement in student behavior. 
~feedback: Incorrect. Here the writer is describing or developing the evidence.

Choose the best paraphrase
1. In the United States, the education system places too much emphasis on formal testing, overlooking the limitations and expenses imposed when that assessment strategy is employed exclusively (Gardner 179).*
~feedback: Correct. This paraphrase is different enough from the original source that it would not be considered plagiarism, so long as Gardner is credited.
2. America has now gone too far toward formal testing, without realizing the costs and limitations of exclusively emphasizing that approach (Gardner 179).
~feedback: That's incorrect. Although the source is cited, the paraphrasing is too close to the original statement as it retained too much of the original wording and sentence structure.
