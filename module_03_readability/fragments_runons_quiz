Elayne has written this passage. What is the best suggestion for how she should spend her time proofreading this draft?  <p>The Jumeirah Beachcomber is my favorite restaurant in Dubai, it sits right on the beach, next to the iconic Burj al-Arab—the world’s only seven-star hotel—built right out in the Arabian Gulf. The restaurant catches the breezes off the water, the salt smell mingles with scents of sandalwood and frankincense. When we last stayed, the food—an expansive buffet of Thai and southern Indian delicacies—stretched out before us. My son got his usual: dragon fruit, chicken tikka masala, and beef with saffron, he headed to the restaurant’s game room. Here, he could play Mario Brothers on the Wii while we talked and laughed with friends: the perfect evening.</p>
