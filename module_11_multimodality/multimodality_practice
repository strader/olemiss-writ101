### 11.1.1 Define multimodality 

~file: define_multimodal_practice

A mode is:
1. One of the five physical senses
~feedback: No, this is not correct. Some of the modes (such as visual and aural) are associated with particular senses, but others (such as linguistic, spatial, and gestural) are not necessarily associated with a particular sense.
2. A means of communication* 
~feedback: This is correct! The five modes -- linguistic, visual, aural, spatial, and gestural -- are different means by which information and arguments are communicated between author and audience.
3. A type of fruit
~feedback: No, this is not correct. You might be thinking of a melon, not a mode :)
4. The channel or system through which a communication is conveyed
~feedback: No, this is not correct. The channel or system through which a communication is conveyed is a medium. An example of a visual medium, for instance, would be photography, painting, or film. 

The term "multimodal" means using all five modes.
1. True
~feedback: No, this is not quite correct. A multimodal artifact uses more than one of the five modes. Some multimodal artifacts may use all the modes, but this is not a necessary condition.
2. False*
~feedback: This is correct. A multimodal artifact is one that uses more than one of the five modes. Some multimodal artifacts may use all the modes, but this is not a necessary condition. The term "multi" is defined as "more than one."

Which of the five modes is represented in the following example?

1. Spatial
~feedback: That's not correct. Though the physical presence of the crossing guard on the street is important, he is not communicating if he's just standing still. 
2. Gestural* 
~feedback: That's correct. The crossing guard communicates with his hands. Drivers follow his instructions by interpreting his gestures. 
3. Aural
~feedback: That's incorrect. There is no indication that the crossing guard is speaking, and he does not have a bull horn. 
4. Linguistic
~feedback: That's incorrect. There is no indication that the crossing guard is using words. 
5. Visual
~feedback: That's incorrect. Though this is an image, the act of communication is based on the crossing guard's gestures. 

Which one of the five modes is most apparent when one looks at the Sydney Opera House?

1. Visual
~feedback: This is not correct. Of course, the opera house is a stunning visual sight, with its angled white roofs and placement, but the effect of seeing the structure float on the water is created by the spatial arrangement of its "sails" above the water.
2. Gestural
~feedback: That's incorrect. The opera house is not moving or signaling. It's static. 
3. Spatial*
~feedback: This is correct; good job! The Sydney Opera House is famous for appearing as it were a ship with many sails floating on the water of the harbor
4. Linguistic
~feedback: This is not correct. There are no words involved in the creation of the Sydney Opera House's presentation.
5. Aural
~feedback: That's incorrect. Though there may be lots of aurality inside the opera house, the structure itself does not communicate with sound.
