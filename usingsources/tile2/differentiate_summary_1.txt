## Evaluate applications of  summary, paraphrase, and quotation 
### Differentiate among paraphrase, summary, and quotation

Which of the following is an example of direct quotation?
~practice 
1. According to Selfe, this mental decay leaves us with some opinions "as firm as bedrock, and just as difficult to remove" (pp?).*

~feedback: Correct.  The phrase “as firm as bedrock, and just as difficult to remove” is original language from the source.  The writer chose to incorporate this direct quotation because Selfe’s metaphor concisely and cleverly captures an important point. 

2. In the article, "the Loneliness of the Interconnected", Charles Selfe argues that people are becoming more and more isolated in our increasingly interconnected world and, furthermore, that bits and pieces of our delicate mental structure are withered away as we increasingly rely on the internet as our source of information.

~feedback: Incorrect.  In this passage, the writer is summarizing Selfe’s article, noting just the author’s main points.

3. As an example of this phenomenon, Selfe describes how, In the 1950s, psychologist Leon Festinger sought to research the point at which this crisis occurs. He contacted a woman by the name of Dorothy Martin who was the leader of a small cult in Chicago. Martin believed that she was writing letters under the command of Clarion, a distant planet. She had concrete belief that Chicago would be wiped out and that the United States would be submerged underwater from a great flood on the morning of December 21, 1955. Her salvation? A spaceman, assumed to be a 'Clarion', would visit Dorothy and her followers hours before the disaster, whisking them away on a spaceship to safety. This bizarre and radical belief was only strengthened when the calamity never arose.  The cult members convinced themselves that the 'Clarions managed to stop the destruction from happening   (Seife, 290-91).

~feedback: Incorrect.  In this passage, the writer is paraphrasing an extended example from Selfe’s article, maintaining the original sequence of the example and including several details.
