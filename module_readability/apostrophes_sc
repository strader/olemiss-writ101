Samuel wrote this passage. Where is there a missing apostrophe? 
<p style=”padding-left: 30px;”>
If you’re preparing for a three-week backpacking trip, don’t forget your most important item: socks. Yes, really! It has been proven that socks can be life saving. Ross Grubers, a backpacker who summited 10 of the world’s tallest peaks, agrees. It has been reported that Grubers socks are “the best money can buy.” His backpack even has its own little space for them.
    <p>
~formative 
1. “It has been reported that Grubers socks...” should read “It has been reported that Grubers’ socks...”* 
~feedback. That’s correct. “Grubers” is in possession of “socks,” so an apostrophe is required (Grubers’). 

2. This passage is correct: no additional apostrophes are necessary
~feedback: That’s incorrect. “Grubers” is in possession of “socks,” so an apostrophe is required (Grubers’). 

2.  “Ross Grubers, a backpacker who summited 10 of the world’s tallest peaks…” should read “Ross Grubers’, a backpacker who summited 10 of the world’s tallest peaks…”
~feedback: That’s incorrect. In this sentence, Grubers is not in possession of anything.
