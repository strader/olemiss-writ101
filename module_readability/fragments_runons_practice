Which of the sentences are run-ons? Identify them based on their number. 
1. 3, 4 *
~feedback: Correct. Sentence 3 needs a comma inserted before the word “and”: Apparently we were wizards, and the law was cracking down on magic. Sentence 4 is also a run-on sentence: While “So” at the beginning of the sentence is technically fine, it’s unnecessary.
2. 1, 2, 5
~feedback: That’s not right. All three sentences are technically correct, even though the “But”  at the start of sentence 5 is unnecessary, and it could be removed without affecting the meaning of the sentence.
3. All the sentences are fragments.
~feedback: That’s incorrect. Look at the difference between sentences 1 and 3. 
4. None of the sentences are fragments. 
~feedback: That’s incorrect. Look at the difference between sentences 1 and 3.
