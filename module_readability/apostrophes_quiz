Samuel wrote this passage. Where is there an unneeded apostrophe? 
<p style=”padding-left: 30px;”>
If you’re preparing for a three-week backpacking trip, don’t forget your most important item: socks. Yes, really! It has been proven that sock’s can be life saving. Ross Grubers, a backpacker who summited 10 of the world’s tallest peaks, agrees. It has been reported that Grubers’ socks are “the best money can buy.” His backpack even has its own little space for them.
