Which of the following is a reason you might question the accuracy of an online source?
1. You cannot verify the information with any other sources.*
~feedback: Correct. This doesn’t necessarily mean the information isn’t accurate; however, you probably want to at least question why no other sources have the same or similar information.

2. The website doesn’t look professional.
~feedback: Incorrect. The looks of a website might matter to some people, but an ugly site doesn’t mean the information contained on it is inaccurate.

3. The source cites others in the same field.
~feedback: Incorrect. Experts in an area often cite others in the field to demonstrate their knowledge of the material.

You are researching your paper on experimental cancer treatments when you find a website from a company which is introducing a new drug. From the website it is clear that the company has three well-known oncologists working for them. One of those doctors has a quotation praising the new drug, and you like the wording. Which of the following best describes how you should evaluate this source?
1. You should look for more objective source information about the drug and use it.*
~feedback: Correct.  It is problematic that the doctor works for the company, and your readers might have a problem with the potential bias.

2. You should use the source information. Oncologists are highly-trained specialists and have a great deal of authority.
~feedback: Incorrect. While it is true that oncologists are highly reliable authorities on cancer treatments, this particular doctor is paid by the drug company, which is a potential conflict of interest and presents a problem with bias.

3. You should not use the source because information on cancer and other diseases should only come from credible hospital websites.
~feedback: Incorrect. Credible information can come from plenty of different places. In this case, the problem with the source is the potential bias since the doctor is employed by the drug company.
