~summative
1. You should use the information in your paper because the director is an authority in this area.*

You are researching a paper on how more concussions are being diagnosed in college football each year when you find a source from ESPN on the number of total season-ending injuries sustained two season ago. After you apply the CRAAP analysis, your best choice is:
~summative
1. You should not use the source because total injuries is far broader than concussions, so the source may not be relevant.*
2. You should not use the source because it is not current enough.
3. You should not use the source because ESPN is not an authority on college football.

You are researching a paper on sanctuary cities when you find a website with an article written by a Sociology professor. The article has numbers on how sanctuary cities have fewer violent crimes than non-sanctuary cities. When you research the site further by looking up who hosts the site, you discover that it is an openly left-leaning organization. After you apply the CRAAP analysis, your best choice is:
~summative
1. Try to find the information somewhere that might be considered more objective so that your readers don’t assume bias.*
2. Use the information in your paper. Statistics are numbers and are thus objective.
3. Avoid using the information in your paper because the author lacks authority.

~summative
1. Avoid using the quotation unless you can verify it and properly cite it.*
2. Use the quotation and cite the senator’s website as the source.
3. Avoid using the quotation because of problems with currency.
