Which answer is a fair evaluation of this statement: I am writing a research paper about the history of grave robbing in Georgia. I come across a podcast by a group of historians from Fayette County, Georgia about grave robbing in Woolsey, Georgia in the 1990s. This is an excellent source to use for my paper. 
~summative
1. This is sound reasoning, because the authors of the podcast have some authority on the subject, it is current to your research topic (historical events), and there is likely not a better source that explains grave robbing in Woolsey in the 1990s. *
2. This is poor reasoning. Podcasts are never reputable sources of information because they are usually free and can be accessed from mobile devices. Real historians would only share their knowledge in peer-reviewed journal articles.
3. This is sound reasoning because people from Fayette County, Georgia are experts about what happened in Woolsey in the 1990s.
