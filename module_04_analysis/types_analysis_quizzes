Naomi Harper needs to analyze the following advertisement: <img src=https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/2097/2017/08/01133930/626px-Boston_Drug_for_Drunkenness.png” alt=”visual ad for a pill that cures drunkenness featuring drunk dancing figures and descriptive text”>  She wants to claim that the ad relies on a false appeal to ethos to sell pills. What is her best evidence for this claim? 
~formative
1. The quotations in the bottom panel by reputable citizens (and witnessed by the sheriff) give the ad's claims an inflated sense of credibility.*
2. The cartoon figures of drunken people in the four corners of the ad confirm that the ad is targeted at credible drunks. 
3. The use of language like “free from desire” and evils of intemperance” is designed to guilt and/or shame customers into buying the pills. 

Eunice Higgins needs to analyze the following advertisement: <img src=https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/2097/2017/08/01133930/626px-Boston_Drug_for_Drunkenness.png” alt=”visual ad for a pill that cures drunkenness featuring drunk dancing figures and descriptive text”>  She thinks the figures in the four corners of the ad represent an appeal to pathos. Is she correct?
~formative
1. Yes, the drunken figures are meant to look ridiculous, and remind viewers of the ad that they do not want to be drunkards.*
2. Yes, the figures are meant to look like doctors and they convey additional credibility.
3. No, the figures are realistic representations of drunkards and are an appeal to logos. 

Vinton Harper needs to analyze the following advertisement as part of his critical analysis assignment: <img src=https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/2097/2017/08/01133930/626px-Boston_Drug_for_Drunkenness.png” alt=”visual ad for a pill that cures drunkenness featuring drunk dancing figures and descriptive text”>  He plans to spend most of the paper writing about the history of the temperance movement. Is this a sound approach? 
~formative
1. No. A critical analysis of an artifact should focus mostly on the artifact itself and use external context only as support.* 
2. Yes. A critical analysis of an artifact should never focus mostly on the artifact itself, and should mostly put the artifact into historical context. 
3. No. A critical analysis of an artifact should focus mostly on the process it recommends and use external context does not aid in understanding of process.
