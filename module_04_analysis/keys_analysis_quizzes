// self-check

1. The idea behind the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue needs to be viewed in context of the feminist movement of the 1960s.

2. The idea behind the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue was to bring images of beautiful women to readers across the globe through full-color images and interesting stories.*
~feedback: Correct. This sentence presents an obvious reason for the advent of the magazine and does not set up a deeper exploration of "how," "why," and "so what."

Read the following analytic thesis statement and determine which answer below best addresses the problem with it: Maybelline's new ad campaign features beautiful models in fun situations because the company wants to distract people from the fact that it still tests products on animals.

~feedback: Incorrect. The statement does include the writer's interpretation of why the ads are produced in a certain way.
2. The claim isn't reasoned.*
~feedback: Correct. Though the ad may feature beautiful models in fun situations and Maybelline may still test products on animals, it is extremely unlikely that the two ideas are related, and very few, if any, reasonable readers would see a connection.
3. The student didn't use analysis to reach the claim.
~feedback: Incorrect. Though the claim here is extremely unlikely, the writer is technically analyzing and making an interpretation.

Read the following analytic thesis statement and determine which of the approaches below is the best for incorporating evidence: Dave Eggers' novel The Circle continues a rich American dystopian literary tradition by showing how those struggling for control of the masses might not always be whom we think and by prodding us to consider the potential consequences of sharing details of our lives with others on social media.
~formative 
1. The writer could reference some previous dystopian works and analyze how Eggers' book builds on those ideas in a modern context where many people don't see dangers in technology.*
~feedback: Correct. This example would contain evidence to back the specific claim that the writer has introduced. 
2. The writer could point out examples of how he or she has shared information on social media and then regretted it later.
~feedback: Incorrect. This example contains no reference to The Circle when the claim sets up an analysis of Eggers' book.
3. The writer could detail a list of previous dystopian literature and analyze the impact it had on the role of technology in American culture.
~feedback: Incorrect. While some such information might work well, this example contains no reference to The Circle when the claim sets up an analysis of Eggers' book.

Read over the following scenario and then determine what is the best approach for the student: Philip is taking a Writing class, and he has been assigned an analysis essay on looking into if a system to pay college athletes is possible across the country. Philip's brother Jackson is a year older than him and plays football for the university. Jackson doesn't have time to work due to his commitments to academics and sports, and Philip knows that his brother has had to borrow money from their uncle to keep up with bills and to afford his car. The writing assignment requires objective research and a minimum of four expert sources. What is Philip's best next step?
~summative
1. Philip knows from his brother's experience that college athletes should be paid, so he should find sources that have endorsed the same view, read them over, and start writing once he decides how to work in the outside material.
2. Philip should step back and do some objective research on how the issue is viewed nationwide, and then he can weigh how his own knowledge of the issue fits into the current discussion.*
3. Philip should contact his brother and ask him for the names of other football players he can talk to so he can be sure to have evidence from people who are close to the situation.
