Read the following brief excerpt from a reflective passage and identify which type of knowledge is most obvious: <p style="padding-left: 30px;">I have mixed feelings about my last draft of the argument paper. On one hand, I feel very confident about my sources and how I was able to integrate them. My 12th grade teacher really pushed us on using sources correctly, and I feel like I am prepared to do that at the college level. One specific example is in the third paragraph of my paper, where I just use a few quoted words from the Taylor source and work it into my sentence. I think that is exactly the kind of integration we were shown in class, and I feel like I entered the semester being able to handle this part well. </p>

Read the following brief excerpt from a reflective passage and identify which type of knowledge is most obvious:<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I realized after our peer review that I wasn’t addressing people who have opposing viewpoints, which was the main goal of the assignment. So I started my revision by adding in two paragraphs of material that showed I understood why people disagreed with my thesis and that they had reasons for thinking that way. This really made my final product better because I was able to revise thinking about writing to reach a lot of people with good research and a balanced tone, not just writing to reinforce my points. I think the final copy reads much better than my draft did, and I felt more organized and confident by fairly considering the views of other people.</p>
