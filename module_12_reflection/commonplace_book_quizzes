Read the following selection from a weekly write and answer the question below. <p style="padding-left: 30px;">What skills do I bring to my project? Well, I want my video to be for incoming college freshmen, and students around my age love memes. Therefore, I bring knowledge of currently popular memes and humor to my project. I’m fairly confident that my knowledge of pop culture in this area will be very useful in creating a project that resonates well with my target audience. Already, I created three memes for my video that sum up different points I want to make in my video. One meme format I chose was "Distracted Boyfriend." This meme has been very popular lately, so I decided to make my own version of it related to my project of luxury student housing. I also chose the "Batman and Robin" and "Roll Safe" meme, because these are also popular memes that I though could fit my project.</p><p>Which type of knowledge does the passage <strong>not</strong> demonstrate?
