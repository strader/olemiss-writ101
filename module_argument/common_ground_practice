Who might be included in President Obama's unintended potential audience? Unintended audiences are those who aren't directly addressed by the content of the argument, as well as those who hold points of view that the author of an argument hasn't considered carefully or at least mentioned in passing.
1. People who think getting rid of religion altogether would help to improve society*
~feedback: Correct! Throughout his speech, President Obama makes claims grounded in the presumption that Christian spirituality is a positive force for social change. 
 
2. People who believe the only way to stop gun violence is to repeal the Second Amendment
~feedback: Consider re-reading the text. President Obama's claim that the "vast majority of Americans" think something should be done to stop gun violence contains an implicit admission that some people do not think of gun violence as a problem that needs to be addressed. Similarly, his claim that, "[w]hatever solutions we find will necessarily be incomplete," implicitly addresses those people who do not believe that gun control legislation would be sufficient to address the problem of gun violence, but instead see repeal of the Second Amendment as the only real solution. Finally, when President Obama explicitly mentions "the majority of gun owners" who "want to do something about this," he is acknowledging those members of his audience who may think all gun owners are or should be against gun control legislation.

Read the statements below carefully. Which describes one of President Obama’s intended audiences?
1. They do not respect Christian beliefs about God and divine grace.
~feedback: That’s not correct. Clearly the president’s speech assumes religious common ground with his audience. 
 
2. They are not aware of the history of American democracy and the civil rights movement.
~feedback. That’s not correct. Obama knows that his audience is familiar with the civil rights movement and makes many references to it. 
 
3. They believe the Confederate flag is a symbol of integrity and justified rebellion against an oppressive government.*
~feedback: Correct! President Obama is clearly addressing those who share his own beliefs and values. He is also, though, hoping to persuade those who may disagree with him, such as citizens who believe the Confederate flag is a symbol of integrity and justified rebellion against an oppressive government.
