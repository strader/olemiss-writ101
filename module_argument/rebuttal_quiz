### 8.4.2 Evaluate strategies for rebuttal and refutation of counter-argument

Chase is a first-year student who served in Afghanistan after high school and is now returning to school. He is writing an argument paper claiming that the military should arm active-duty soldiers with a less expensive weapon than the one being used currently. Chase owns several weapons and is quite familiar with the specifications and prices of many models. He knows that lobbyists for one of the government weapons contracts made a strong pitch recently to keep their gun as the standard issue for troops, so he is writing a section rebutting some of the information they presented. Which of the following is his best path?
~summative
1. Chase should rely on his high knowledge of weapons to write the rebuttal/refutation. He has personal experience that will guide him through the argument.
 
2. Chase’s personal experience does not matter in an academic argument. He needs to find other voices to put his thoughts into words.
 
3. Chase should use his personal knowledge to help him, but he should also check his information and find source material that might assist in making his claims.*
 
Sean is writing an argument essay claiming that violent games do not cause children to become more aggressive. He is incorporating a source from a journal on adolescent behavior which asserts male children between 9-13 who play violent video games participated in more aggressive acts over a two-month observation period than did male children the same ages who did not play violent video games. Sean has acknowledged the study, but he is now rebutting the source, noting that there isn’t much information about the subjects’ home lives. Which of the following is the best option for a sentence in his rebuttal?
~summative
1. Though the study reveals some troubling data, the researchers purposely ignored providing information about the children’s home lives so that video games looked like the culprit.
 
2. Though the study reveals some troubling data, the article does not provide complete information on the children’s home lives, which may have shed more light into their behavioral patterns.* 
 
3. Though the study reveals some troubling data, the article was published in an academic journal by liberal researchers who want to ban violent video games. 
 
Denise has been reading up on vaccinations and how some parents choose not to immunize their children.

Which of the following is the best option for a sentence in her rebuttal?
~summative
1. Children need to be vaccinated because outbreaks may occur within communities if enough people aren’t immunized.*
 
2. Children need to be vaccinated because outbreaks will occur within communities if enough people aren’t immunized.
