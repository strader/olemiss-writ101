## 8.3 Evaluate rhetorical approaches to building common ground

### 8.3.1 Recognize rhetorical approaches to building common ground

All of the following are important rhetorical factors to consider when building common ground except:
~formative
1. Number of Sources*
~feedback: That’s correct. The number of sources could be important to the argument’s credibility, but it doesn’t build common ground with the audience. The main rhetorical factors to consider when building common ground are tone, language, and appeals. 
2. Tone
~feedback: That’s incorrect. The main rhetorical factors to consider when building common ground are tone, language, and appeals. If you do not consider tone, you risk patronizing or offending your audience. 
3. Language
~feedback: That’s incorrect. The main rhetorical factors to consider when building common ground are tone, language, and appeals. If you do not consider language, your risk alienating your audience or obfuscating your purpose. 
4. Appeals
~feedback: That’s incorrect. The main rhetorical factors to consider when building common ground are tone, language, and appeals. If you do not consider appeals, your argument may be easily ignored by your audience. 
 
Which of the following would not be considered a discourse community?
~formative
1. A scientist, a politician, a baker, and a murderer who all speak the same language.*
~feedback: That’s correct. Even though the scientist, politician, baker, and murderer probably have things in common, their common ground isn’t sufficient to be considered a discourse community (any more than speakers of the same language make up a discourse community). 
2. A group of social workers attending a social work conference.
~feedback: That’s incorrect. Social workers in general have a shared vocabulary and training, and since they are attending the same conference, they have shared professional interests. 
3. The local bird watching club.
~feedback: That’s incorrect. The local bird watching club has shared experience with the birds in the community, and use specialized language to refer to bird sightings. 
4. Faculty members in a sociology department
~feedback: That’s incorrect. Faculty members in academic departments usually have similar training, backgrounds, and interests. Though the focus of their research may differ, they share disciplinary common ground. 
 
Which of the following is a way to build common ground in an argument essay about legislation to eliminate gender-based pay inequities? 
~formative
1. Changing the phrase “militant femi-Nazis” to “proponents of the pay equity legislation”*
~feedback: Correct.  Revising language so that it is not hostile is a way to build common ground.
2. Adding more words to meet the length requirements 
~feedback: Incorrect.  While this action improve the essay, it is not a way to build common ground.
3. Reorganizing paragraphs to improve the logic of the argument
~feedback: Incorrect.  While this action may improve the essay, it is not a way to build common ground.
4. Adding transitions between paragraphs 
~feedback: Incorrect.  While this action may improve the essay, it is not a way to build common ground.

### 8.3.2 Evaluate rhetorical approaches to building common ground

You are a dietician invited to speak to a meeting of Overeaters Anonymous. What rhetorical approach should you use to build common ground with them? 
~formative
1. You should talk with them in a casual, informal tone, and work to build trust. Explain your purpose for being there without being patronizing. Make sure you use language that a general audience would understand, and work to build your credibility. *
~feedback: Correct.  All of these techniques would help build common ground.
2. You should lecture them about their poor choices, and make sure they know you’re the authority on their poor choices. Explain that you are there to correct their ways, and give them instructions using formal, technical language. 
~feedback: Incorrect.  These actions would likely be seen as an attack, thereby decreasing the argument’s persuasiveness and failing to build common ground.
3. You should lie about who you are and infiltrate the group in order to further your own dietetic clinic. You should exaggerate facts and play up your appeals to emotion in order to get the other members of the group to enlist your clinic’s services. 
~feedback: Incorrect.  These actions would decrease your credibility as a speaker rather than building common ground.
 
Lisa is a first-year student who is working on a campus project to increase recycling in the fraternity and sorority houses. She has been invited to address the student body government about her ideas. The government has been very reluctant to pass measures in the past that add rules to Greek houses. What is Lisa’s best rhetorical approach in addressing the group?
~formative
1. Lisa should devote her energies to arguing that Greek houses haven’t have to abide by the same rules as do regular students and that it is time for that to change.
~feedback: Incorrect. Approaching the situation from a negative perspective rather than a positive one is unlikely to win Lisa much support or to help her build common ground.
2. Lisa should criticize members of the government for not caring about the school’s carbon footprint and bemoan their reluctance to enact more rules in the past.
~feedback: Incorrect. Approaching the situation from a negative perspective rather than a positive one is unlikely to win Lisa much support or to help her build common ground.
3. Lisa should emphasize the philanthropic aspect of fraternities and sororities and point out that enhanced recycling would give the Greek houses a chance to contribute positively to the community and campus while benefitting everyone in the long term because all students gain from a cleaner environment.*
~feedback: Correct. Lisa can build common ground with both the student government and the Greek houses by highlighting how everyone gains from certain changes. Further, a positive tone is likely to help her cause.   
 
Marcia is anticipating a difficult conversation with her parents in which she will be asking them to help her buy a car.  She jots down a draft of what she might say and decides that the following sentences will be a way to build common ground:  “Mom and Dad, I admire both of you so much.  I know you both held jobs while you were in college to help out with expenses.  You have told me so often how the time management skills you acquired by juggling the demands of work and school were so valuable to you. I would like to follow your lead and try to get a part-time job, too.”  Do those sentences build common ground?
~formative
True*
~feedback: Correct.  By appealing to pathos and ethos (“admire”) as well as logos (acquiring time management skills), Marcia is building common ground.
False
~feedback: Incorrect.  Think about the ways Marcia appeals to emotion, credibility, and logic.
