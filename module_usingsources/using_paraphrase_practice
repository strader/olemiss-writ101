Choose the best paraphrase
1. In the United States, the education system places too much emphasis on formal testing, overlooking the limitations and expenses imposed when that assessment strategy is employed exclusively (Gardner 179).
~feedback: Correct. This paraphrase is different enough from the original source that it would not be considered plagiarism, so long as Gardner is credited.

2. America has now gone too far toward formal testing, without realizing the costs and limitations of exclusively emphasizing that approach (Gardner 179).
~feedback: That's incorrect. Although the source is cited, the paraphrasing is too close to the original statement as it retained too much of the original wording and sentence structure.
