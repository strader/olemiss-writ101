<p>Read the following passage:</p><p>Although most people are confident that they could not be fooled by a fake news article, research shows evidence to the contrary. Economists Hunt Allcott and Matthew Gentzkow conducted an experiment to see if people believed fake articles that the researchers had created themselves. They called these articles “placebo” fake news articles. They surveyed people and asked them if they could recall seeing the article in question reported or discussed prior to the election. The researchers found that some participants claimed they had heard the “placebo” articles mentioned during the election season. However, the study also indicated that “most widely circulated hoaxes were seen by only a small fraction of Americans” (Crawford). Despite the narrow viewership of fake news articles, they do have the power to influence at least some readers’ beliefs and possibly influence those readers’ actions.</p><p>Which of the following contains a signal phrase?</p>
