### 10.4.1 Recognize markers of credibility in writing 

Effective integration of source material builds credibility in each of the following ways except:
~formative
1. Length of the source material adds to the word count.
~feedback: Correct.  Length is not a marker of credibility.*

2. Evidence adds to the argument’s persuasiveness.
~feedback: Incorrect.  Evidence adds to the argument’s persuasiveness, thereby building credibility.

3. Signal phrase highlights the reputation and qualifications of the source.
~feedback: Incorrect.  Signal phrases highlight the source’s reputation and qualifications, thereby building credibility. 

4. Citation demonstrates trustworthiness of the writer.
~feedback: Incorrect.  Citation demonstrates the writer’s trustworthiness, thereby building credibility.
  
Effective integration of source material builds credibility in each of the following ways except:
~formative
1. Source material is substituted for the writer’s arguments.*
~feedback: Correct.  Source material supports a writer’s arguments rather than substituting for the writer’s arguments.  If the source material takes the place of the writer’s own ideas and arguments, it diminishes the writer’s credibility.

2. Explanation of relevance of the source material to the writer’s argument.
~feedback: Incorrect.  Explanation of the relevance of the source material to the writer’s argument demonstrates the writer’s critical thinking and reasoning, thereby enhancing his or her credibility.

3. Evidence adds to the argument’s persuasiveness.
~feedback: Incorrect.  Evidence adds to the argument’s persuasiveness, thereby enhancing credibility.

4. Signal phrase highlights the reputation and qualifications of the source.
~feedback: Incorrect.  Signal phrases highlight the source’s reputation and qualifications, thereby enhancing credibility.

One way effective integration of source material builds credibility is by demonstrating the relevance of the material to the writer’s argument.
~formative
1. True*
~feedback: Correct.  By demonstrating the relevance of the source material to the argument, the writer demonstrates his or her critical thinking and reasoning skills, thereby building his or her credibility.

2. False
~feedback: Incorrect.  By demonstrating the relevance of the source material to the argument, the writer demonstrates his or her critical thinking and reasoning skills, thereby building his or her credibility.

### 10.4.2 Differentiate among the markers of credibility in writing

Including a source’s credentials, such as Harvard Distinguished Professor, in the first reference to a source is an example of:
~formative
1. Signal phrase highlighting the reputation and qualifications of the source.*
~feedback: Correct.  By highlighting the reputation and qualifications of a source through a signal phrase, the writer builds the credibility of the source.

2. Evidence adding to the argument’s persuasiveness.
~feedback: Incorrect.  Evidence is the source material itself, not the source’s credentials.

3. Citation demonstrating the trustworthiness of the writer.
~feedback: Incorrect.  Citation is the bibliographic information for the source, not the source’s credentials.

4. Relevance of the source to the writer’s argument
~feedback: Incorrect.  Relevance is the way the source material is related to the writer’s argument, not the source’s credentials.

Including reference information which helps the reader easily find the source is an example of:
~formative
1. Citation demonstrating the trustworthiness of the writer.*
~feedback: Correct.  By providing accurate, complete citation of a source, the writer demonstrates his or her trustworthiness.

2. Signal phrase highlighting the reputation and qualifications of the source.
~feedback: Incorrect.  A signal phrase is an introduction to the source material, not reference information.

3. Evidence adding to the argument’s persuasiveness.
~feedback: Incorrect.  Evidence adding to the argument’s persuasiveness is the source material itself, not the reference information.

4. Relevance of the source to the writer’s argument.
~feedback: Incorrect.  Explaining the relevance of the source to the writer’s argument is how the writer demonstrates his or her critical thinking and reasoning, not reference information.

Explaining how the source material supports the writer’s point is an example of:
~formative
1. Relevance of the source to the writer’s argument.*
~feedback: Correct.  By explaining the relevance of the source to the argument, a writer demonstrates critical thinking and reasoning, thereby building credibility.

2. Citation demonstrating the trustworthiness of the writer.
~feedback: Incorrect.  Citation is providing accurate, complete bibliographical information for a source, not explaining how the source material is related to the writer’s point.

3. Evidence adding to the argument’s persuasiveness.
~feedback: Incorrect.  Evidence is material from the source, not the writer’s explanation of that material’s relevance to his or her point.

4. Signal phrase highlighting the reputation and qualifications of the source.
~feedback: Incorrect.  A signal phrase introduces source material rather than explaining its relevance to the writer’s point.
