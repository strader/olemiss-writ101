<p>A classmate comes to you for advice on an essay she has written. The instructor told her to revise the paper and use fewer direct quotations in the next draft. However, your classmate doesn’t want to lose the details from the source she is citing. You advise her to:</p>
~formative
1. Paraphrase and cite the significant parts of the article.*
~feedback: That’s right! Concise, clear paraphrase ensures that more of the paper is in the classmate’s own voice. 

2. Put all the quotations into her own words and add new details.
~feedback: That’s incorrect. Some direct quotations may be necessary, and there is more to paraphrasing than simply changing the words. 

3. Summarize and cite the entire article.
~feedback: That’s incorrect. Summaries use fewer details than paraphrases or direct quotations. 

<p>Read the following passage and a paraphrase of it. How would you evaluate the paraphrase?</p>
<p>Original: ”There is, in fact, a nearly universally accepted logical and rhetorical structure to mathematical exposition. For over two millennia serious mathematics has been presented following a format of definition-theorem-proof. Euclid’s <em>Elements</em> from circa 300 BC codified this mode of presentation which, with minor variations in style, is still used today in journal articles and advanced texts” (Jamison 46)”</p>
<p>Paraphrase: Mathematical exposition has a galactically believed rhetorical and logical foundation. For over two thousand years, difficult mathematics has been shown to adhere to a format of definition-theorem-proof. Euclid wrote <em>Elements</em> in 300 BC and talked about this method of math that math professors still write about these days in academic research. (Jamison 46)</p>
~formative
1. This is not a good paraphrase. It follows the word order of the original source too closely and merely changes the author’s words to their synonyms. The paraphrase is actually less clear than the original text. *
~feedback: Correct! 

2. This is a good paraphrase. It changes all the words from the original text and does not plagiarize the author’s ideas. It is also strong because it is equal in length to the original. 
~feedback: That’s incorrect. Paraphrase should make the content clearer than the original text and simply choosing synonyms of the author’s words may change the meaning of the passage. 

3. This is not a good paraphrase. It does not add the writer’s opinions and argument to the author’s original claim. 
~feedback: That’s incorrect. A paraphrase should not change the meaning of the author’s original text. 


Which of the following is an appropriate use of summary?
~formative
1. As part of your research paper, you are writing an annotated bibliography of 5 sources. Each of your sources is between 15 and 20 pages, and you write five sentences for each one that describe the author’s key points. *
~feedback: Correct! 

2. You are assigned to write a critical review of a book. Your approach is to write the “SparkNotes” version of the book, condensing each chapter by about 80%. You are careful not to make any new claims about the book. 
~feedback: That’s incorrect. A <en>critical</em> book review should contain both summary and your own claims and evaluation of the text. 

3. Your research paper should include citations from at least 5 sources. You do not have time to read the fifth article to find a specific passage to paraphrase or quote. Instead, you simply write about the article generally based on what the abstract says. 
~feedback: That’s incorrect. Summary is not a useful shortcut, and you may miss important nuances if you don’t read the full source.
