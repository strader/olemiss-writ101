<p>What is the best advice you could offer your classmate for paraphrasing the following quote?</p>
<p>“There are surprisingly few methods of causing something to move. With a couple of exceptions, everything starts out going around and around, and then that circular motion gets turned into some other path as needed. That being said, there is often some other thing you might want your robot to do that isn't, strictly speaking, movement related, and all that goes into actuation” (Geiger).</p>
~summative
1. Start by putting the thesis into your own words; then list out the main ideas from the quote. Use quotation marks and cite the source if you borrow any phrasing. Expect your paraphrase to be about as long as the original.*

2. Start by identifying the thesis statement. Then make sure that you get only the main ideas, so you can keep this really short. Don’t use any words from the original.

3. Start by putting the thesis into your own words; then give your interpretation of the material. Highlight the points you find most interesting. Add quotes and citations when you make comments.

<p>Which of the following is a good paraphrase of the following passage? </p>

2. Students have a hard time with the precision of math articles. They are used to talking in slang, while as math is supposed to be boring and dry. 

3. This quotation should not be paraphrased because the idea it expresses is already as clear as it can be. 

Which of the following is <strong>not</strong> an appropriate use of summary? 
~summative
