Read Lincoln's "Gettysburg Address," and then answer the questions below.  <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war.

It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"> But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate-we can not consecrate-we can not hallow-this ground.

Rachel has an exam in her Political Science class. In addition to covering lecture notes, the exam will feature a written response to a set of three short articles written by politicians from rural areas and how they have made an impact in Washington, D.C. What is the best way for Rachel to prepare before she reads the articles?
~formative
1. Talk to her classmates about which of the articles is most important so she can write about it the most.
~feedback: Incorrect. Though it might be helpful to talk to classmates about the articles, it is unlikely the professor expects students to determine one as most important and deserving of more attention. Think about rhetorical context.
2. Learn about the three politicians and their home areas so she better understands the rhetorical context for the articles.*
~feedback: Correct. Better understanding the rhetorical context for the writings may help Rachel provide deeper insight in her response.
3. Decide which article to focus on the most so she can read it more carefully and annotate it well.
~feedback: Incorrect. It is unlikely the professor expects students to determine one article as most important and deserving of more attention. Think about rhetorical context.

Steve is writing an analysis of a William Faulkner short story for his American Literature course. He read his assignment carefully three times; learned more about Faulkner on a website; read the story twice, annotating it each time; and made a short list of vocabulary words that he has looked up, studied, and used in other contexts. What is his best next step before drafting his paper?
~formative
1. Steve has completed all possible steps of the reading loop and should begin drafting.
~feedback: Incorrect. Though Steve has been thorough in his reading process so far, there are many other steps he can take to help expand his knowledge of the text, his own purpose, and the author's rhetorical context. 
2. Steve could meet with a classmate to discuss their thoughts on the text and the circumstances under which it was written.*
~feedback: Correct. Checking your comprehension (and perhaps furthering it) of a reading can be a valuable part of the process.
3. Steve should continue annotating the text because more notes is better when writing an analysis.
~feedback: Incorrect. More notes does not always mean better comprehension of a reading.

Rosalinda is reading a four-page, difficult passage about ethics in her Philosophy class. Which of the following is the best strategy while she reads?
~formative
1. Connect ideas from the passage to what she has learned about ethics in her church group.*
~feedback: Correct. Connecting a text to what you already know about a topic is a good reading strategy.
2. Read very small bits of the passage over several days to make sure she has plenty of time to think about the material.
~feedback: Incorrect. While taking a break during reading is often a good idea, reading a four-page passage shouldn't take several days. Perhaps she may re-read the passage after a break to help with comprehension.
3. Highlight all the parts she doesn't understand so she can focus on them later.
~feedback: Incorrect. While highlighting can be useful, think of annotating a text as having a conversation with it. Write questions, and try to pinpoint what it is that you don't understand so that you are actively thinking about the text.

Archie, your classmate, has been working with you to improve his reading skills. He tells you, "I'm trying to summarize this article for Professor Mehitabel's class. I can't seem to stop myself from just writing out everything in my own words. It's taking forever." Which response should you offer to help him get better with active reading?
~summative
1. "Archie, you've got to write down all the stuff in the headings and make an outline first. Then you can try summarizing based on that. A summary is just the article, only shorter."
2. "Archie, while working on active reading, don't worry about summarizing. Focus instead on marking words and concepts as you go, and make predictions about what is coming. Create a vocabulary list for the things to define later."*
3. "Archie, it sounds like you're paraphrasing rather than summarizing. Make sure your notes all use exact language from the article so that you can find the passages later when you are studying."

You just finished reading a long assignment and take a look at the pages of notes you made about it. How are you going to make sense of what you just read so that you don't forget it?
~summative
1. It is time to begin another reading of the book after a break. For the next reading, take notes on all of the parts you had difficulty with the first time and then talk about them with your professor.
2. It is time to take your notes and create an outline or concept map so that you can summarize the material. You read actively, annotating your text and making a vocabulary list, so you have the ingredients you need for a summary.*
3. It is time to look over the book to see how it is put together structurally. You need to make notes on the key questions you want to answer as you skim, and you need to review what you already know about the subject.

Tabitha completed the reading process loop by reviewing her Organic Chemistry reading notes. What advantage did she have over her classmates who only highlighted the key terms in the book?
~summative
1. Tabitha had physical proof that she actually read and could use her review concept maps and summaries as backup for an open note exam.
2. The review helped her recall the content because she made links between the concepts and the material she already knew. Now her new vocabulary terms have context for her.*
3. The concept maps, summaries, matrices, and group discussions she did provided evidence that she fully understood the material and was prepared for the quiz. 

One of your reading group members, Hunter, is reading over the section headings in the assigned chapters of your course's Biology textbook. He says he wants to get a better sense of the content of the two chapters before he reads them. What is your best response to help him with active reading?
~summative
1. "I would just get to the reading, Hunter. Our group wants to study for the test, so we need to discuss what the exam might cover."
2. "That is a good idea, Hunter. If you know the main parts of the chapters, you might not need to read all the pages and still be covered for the test."
3. "That is a good idea, Hunter. It will help you think about possible relationships in the material and how the text is structured."* 

Your friend Christina meets you for lunch early in the semester and says she doesn't understand what's going on in the Art History class she is taking and that you took last semester. You remember that you did well in the class but it took a lot of careful reading to be prepared for the exams and to write the term paper. Christina says she has blown off the required reading and now feels overwhelmed. What is your best advice for your friend?
~summative
1. You tell Christina that she should go meet with the professor and explain that she doesn't know what is going on the course and needs help with what to read.
2. You tell Christina that she should talk to classmates about the reading that she hasn't done so she can get a better sense of what she has missed so far.
3. You tell Christina that she should start by looking over the course goals and upcoming assignments so she better understands her rhetorical context as a reader.*

Faced with the trauma of an underdeveloped vocabulary, your best friend asks you what tools she should use to help her study for the GRE. She is always online and likes to play games. After evaluating her situation and needs, which is the most effective advice for her situation?
~formative
1. "Your vocabulary will come if you read, read, read. Don't sweat the small stuff. The average newspaper in this country is written at the 6th grade level, isn't it?"
2. "Keep track of the words people say and write them down. Look them up, keeping track of meanings and classifying them for your own personal lexicon." 
3. "That laptop of yours can do more than access Facebook. Use Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary to look things up and play games with sites like Word Games on Yahoo."*

Using the context clue provided, what is the most accurate definition of the word in bold?  The head of the <strong>ophidian</strong> raised from the shoulder of the statue and disappeared, to glide out from beneath the arm in a swift undulation, its jaws open, its tongue vibrating. 
~formative
1. The description includes gliding, open jaws, and a vibrating tongue. This suggests that an ophidian is probably a snake. *
2. The sentence mentions the shoulder of a statue, so ophidian must refer to a type of statue. 
3. Ophidia means "invisible" because of the word "disappeared." 

True or false: the word "interdigitate" probably means "to interlock fingers" because the root "inter" means "between" and "dig" is the root for "finger.

Fran wants to start keeping a Lexicon to help her prepare for the LSAT. She hates computers and technology but has heard that she should keep her lexicon online. What advice do you give her? 
~summative
1. Fran should keep her personal lexicon in an encrypted, synced notebook. She should buy a smartphone to access the online lexicon and should focus on its design and presentation. 
2. Fran should choose a medium that works for her: maybe a small notebook and pencil would be best. She should use the notebook to record interesting words for later use.*
3. Fran should not do this. The only effective way to learn vocabulary for the LSAT is to study law dictionaries. 

Thelma and Fay are arguing over the meaning of of "antidisestablishmentarianism." What is the best method for them to quickly figure out the meaning?
~summative
1. They should pay attention to the root words "anti," "dis" and the word ending "ism." They probably recognize the word "establish," so they can use the different meanings of root words to come up with a good guess.*
2. They should place a bet and go purchase a dictionary. Whoever wins the bet gets her money back. A dictionary is the only way to determine the meaning of a word with enough certainty to win an argument. 
3. They should write the word down in their personal lexicons and plan to return to it at another date. 

Using the context clue provided, what is the most accurate definition of the word in bold?  <p>He was the only person in New York who might be called, without intent to malign, an <strong>Ultracrepidarian</strong> critic. It was of the very nature of his job to find fault with small and insignificant details.</p>
~summative
1. The second sentence says the very nature of his job is to find fault with insignificant details. Given the proximity to the first sentence, and the word "critic," the word probably means someone who gives unwanted advice outside areas of his/her expertise.* 
2. Because the first sentence says he was the only person in New York, the word likely means "sole resident." 
3. The context clues in this sentence suggest that word means to take care of small animals in New York.

Bubba doesn't know the meaning of the word "tenet" in the following quotation. Which context clues could he use to help infer a meaning? <p style="padding-left: 30px;">In fact, the notion that students should have ownership of their writing (in some form or another) has virtually become a <strong>tenet</strong> of composition. It's safe to say that the belief that students should maintain some kind of ownership of their writing has become part of the "common sense" of our field.</p>
~formative
1. "It's safe to say that the belief… has become part of the ‘common sense' of our field" restates the idea of "tenet."*
2. "In fact, the notation that students should have ownership" provides a definition of "tenet." 
3. "Composition" is a synonym of "tenet." 

Which context clue type is going to be most useful in decoding the word <i>sicklesnorted</i> in the following passage? <p style="padding-left: 30px;">We adopted a new approach. First, we identified current oil palm plantations in 20 countries using high-resolution imagery. Second, we examined what proportion of these sites were recently <i>sicklesnorted</i>and compared this to trends in the FAO's estimates of the total area planted in oil palm. Third, we mapped where forests are vulnerable to deforestation for oil palm based on an FAO crop suitability model and the location of current IUCN category I and II protected areas. We did so for both current climatic conditions and those projected for 2080. Finally, we mapped the biodiversity of mammals and birds in these vulnerable forests to attempt to identify where future oil palm expansion may be most damaging.</p>
~formative
1. <i>Sicklesnorted</i> likely means deforested. We know this because of the example type of clue in the last sentence.
2. <i>Sicklesnorted</i> likely means planted. We know this because of the synonym type of context clue when they mention planted in the last part of the sentence.

Explain which context clue type is going to be most useful in decoding the word <em>shoopdada.</em> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Now any fool can see that if x is considered as made up of a lot of little bits, each of which is called dx, if you add them all up together you get the sum of all the dx's, (which is the same thing as the whole of x). The word <em>"shoopdada"</em> simply means "the whole." If you think of the duration of time for one hour, you may (if you like) think of it as cut up into 3600 little bits called seconds. The whole of the 3600 little bits added up together make one hour.</p>
~formative
1. <em>Shoopdada</em> means number. We know this because of the synonym and the general sense of the paragraph. 
2. <em>Shoopdada</em> means little bits. We know this from the general sense of the paragraph and the example. 
3. <em>Shoopdada</em> means integer or "the whole." We know this because of examples and a synonym.*

Amos doesn't know the word "hegemony" in the following sentence. What context clues can help him figure out its meaning? <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Many things men consider to be "human" or "neutral" are in fact norms that exist to reinforce male hegemony.</p>
~summative
1. "Hegemony" probably means control or dominance because the sentence implies that what men consider "human" or "neutral" is actually a social norm under their control.*
2. "Hegemony" probably means gender because of the word's proximity to the word "male." 
3. "Hegemony" probably means lack of control or dominance because the sentence implies that what men consider "human" or "neutral" is actually a social norm not under their control.

Analyze this paragraph from the body of a research paper. Is it an effective paragraph? Why or why not? <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Vuoskoski and Eerola in their study titled "Can Sad Music Really Make You Sad? Indirect Measures of Affective States Induced by Music and Autobiographical Memories" focus on the emotion of sadness. Their research starts with four groupings: sad music picked by them, neutral music, sad music picked out by the participants, and sad recall. The participants listened to these and then were asked to remember words that they had heard before listening. The results of the experiment were that in the first two categories (sad music chosen and neutral music) the amount of positive and negative words remembered were roughly equal; in the third category of sad music chosen individually there was a notable difference and even more of one in sad recall (Vuoskoski and Eerola 208).</p>
~formative
1. This paragraph lacks purpose, and could be strengthened with a key sentence.*
2. The paragraph would be stronger if the author quoted more and paraphrased less.
3. This is a strong paragraph because it focuses on explaining one piece of research.

Identify the logical problems in this paragraph: <p style="padding-left: 30px;"> Financial strain, work and family conflict, and marital dissatisfaction may be bi-products of the emotional and time commitments dual income families generate. For the majority of dual income families, the women feel more of the gender inequality with regards to parental responsibilities and thus are linked to greater distress and anger. The good mother model is inflexible and maintains that mothers are to be involved, always available and committed to the family. Furthermore, the father role appears to be more flexible as they are seen as both breadwinners and caregivers. With this flexibility come social expectations that foster more time for enjoyment. Given these circumstances, fathers may not experience the stress and role strain that working mothers feel. </p>
~formative
1. "Furthermore" is the wrong transitional word to indicate contrast.*
2. There is nothing to introduce the concept of the "good mother" and it reads like a tangent. *
3. "Given these circumstances" is the wrong transitional phrase to show causation or correlation. 
4. The last sentence is the most important claim, so it should be at the beginning of the paragraph. 

How could the sentences in this paragraph be organized more logically? Put the sentences in order by number.  <p style="padding-left: 30px;">[1] Depression can lead to a variety of issues, and in the latest study, research has begun showing that women experience higher rates of depression compared to men. [2] Since the female mind matures before males in terms of emotions and sensitivity it makes them more exposed to depression and anxiety. [3] The way that scientists have discovered the difference between the way girls and boys process emotions is through brain scans that show the different "emotional stimuli." [4] There are definitely symptoms that one can spot, so if someone sees any symptoms in a person they can try and help them. [5] Symptoms to watch for would include "changes in her mood, including sadness or irritability, or in her behavior, including, appetite, energy level, sleep patterns and academic performance." [6] The first thing to notice is withdrawal or even just when the girl stops doing activities she usually loves doing.</p>

Identify the logical problem in this paragraph: <p style="padding-left: 30px;">The "prison industrial complex" is a term that describes a complex interlocking web of institutions that extends outward beyond any one jail or prison into the larger political economy and loops back to the thousands of jails and prisons that house men and women for crimes for which they have been convicted. Prisoners are alienated and forced to work to reduce the time for their crimes, and some are often not compensated at all. Major corporations like Wal-Mart, JC Penny, AT&T, and ExxonMobil were among a few notable companies that participate in the exploitation of the prison labor. The prison industrial complex is like a hungry lion that has to be fed and its growth has been substantial. This enterprise is governed by the principles of earning a profit for the private sector rather than fulfilling basic human needs.</p>
~summative
1. Metaphors like "the prison industrial complex is a hungry lion" disrupt the coherence of the paragraph. 
2. The sentence "this enterprise is governed by the principles of earning profit for the private sector rather than fulfilling basic human needs" should be at the beginning of the paragraph.
3. A strong transitional phrase before "major corporations like Wal-Mart" would make the message more clear. 
4. The paragraph has no logical problems* 

How could the sentences in this paragraph be organized more logically?

Bobby is writing an argument paper with a main claim that Major League Baseball needs to implement some rule changes to get younger fans interested in watching the sport. Which of the following is the best option for the first sentence of his introduction?
~formative
1. According to Merriam-Webster, the definition of baseball is "a game played with a bat and ball between two team of nine players each on a large field having four bases that mark the corners a runner must take to score."
~feedback: Incorrect. Most readers are familiar with baseball and don't need a dictionary definition to get them thinking about the topic.
2. Higher television ratings in the coming years will help the sport of baseball make the transition into an era of fans watching sports on the go with digital devices. 
~feedback: Incorrect. This sentence makes a prediction about the future of baseball and is more suited for a conclusion, after Robby has written his thesis statement and support.
3. The game of baseball is called "America's Pastime" and has been played professionally in the United States for about a century-and-half, but the sport's originators could have never anticipated keeping modern fans glued to televisions sets day after day for more than six months each year.*
~feedback: Correct. This sentence hits some of the goals of orienting readers such as providing background, locating readers in a specific time and place, and laying out the stakes for Robby's piece of writing.

I want to commit to at least five hours a week of reading in the library and see how my grades turn out in the coming semester.

If not, I will have at least gained the knowledge from a lot of reading in a less-distracting environment.

Samantha is writing an advertisement analysis paper in her Composition class. Her ad is for De Beers diamonds, and in her introduction she notes the company's slogan: "A Diamond is Forever." As she writes her conclusion, Samantha emphasizes her thesis statement with fresh language and considers ending with another reference to the slogan. Is this a good strategy in a conclusion?
~formative
1. No. Samantha shouldn't repeat anything in her paper.
~feedback: Incorrect. Using a "bookend" or "call back" is often an effective strategy in a conclusion. 
2. No. Samantha should avoid writing anything but a recap of her thesis statement and main points of support in the conclusion.
~feedback: Incorrect. Using a "bookend" or "call back" is often an effective strategy in a conclusion. Also, simply repeating exactly what has been already written is not a great way to end a paper.
3. Yes. Samantha should refer back to an idea she brought up in the introduction if she thinks it fits her work.*
~feedback: Correct. Using a "bookend" or "call back" is often an effective strategy in a conclusion.

Which of the following sentences would work best to start an introduction in an argument paper on how families can work together to cut back on social media use?
~summative
1. Cell phones - everyone has them these days, and no one is able to stay off them for more than five seconds.
2. Parents probably already know that their kids spend a lot of time on digital devices, but a 2016 study shows teens on average spend close to a whopping nine hours per day on social media.*

Nina is writing her conclusion to an Urban Planning project where she spent part of the semester interviewing people at homeless shelters. She realized during her interviews that many of the homeless people wanted badly to work but needed a permanent address for job applications. Thus, her paper evolved into a plan to open a series of halfway houses that could help reduce the city's homeless population while helping to fill some positions that stay open or experience high turnover. Which of the following passages would best fit in her conclusion?
~summative
1. As you can see from the data provided, we have the financial capacity and a clear economic purpose to create halfway homes that would provide permanent addresses for many of the city's homeless; however, we should do so not simply for these reasons but because it is the right action to take in terms of helping our less fortunate citizens find greater meaning and a chance at more happiness in their lives.* 
2. One potential solution to help our city reduce the homeless population and fill open jobs is to create halfway houses. Such residences would allow homeless people to establish a permanent address and broaden their job opportunities, resulting in a long-term win-win for the city and its residents.
3. The city of Rebelville has a homeless population estimated at over 300 people, which is an alarmingly high number for a city of around 20,000 people. Many residents are completely unaware that there are any homeless people at all in the area.

Read the following short introduction paragraph from a thesis-driven Literary Analysis assignment and determine which is the best organizational structure: Bierce uses images of fire, heat, and light versus darkness to create a religious struggle within Peyton Fahrquhar. Though Ambrose Bierce was renowned for his keen sense of humor, his short story "An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge" is anything but witty. The story appears to readers to be a tale of Civil War soldier Fahrquhar's last minutes before his death by hanging. Underneath the surface, Bierce is telling a story of a man's struggle between Heaven and Hell, and then, the final moments that decide his fate.
~summative
1. The structure is fine as is for an introduction.
2. The introduction would work better if what is currently the first sentence became the final sentence of the paragraph in order to better build up to the thesis statement.*
3. The introduction would work better if the student added more analysis in support of the thesis statement.

It has been reported that Grubers socks are "the best money can buy." His backpack even has its own little space for them.</p>
~formative

All of the following are important rhetorical factors to consider when building common ground except:
~formative
1. Number of Sources*
~feedback: That's correct. The number of sources could be important to the argument's credibility, but it doesn't build common ground with the audience. The main rhetorical factors to consider when building common ground are tone, language, and appeals. 
2. Tone
~feedback: That's incorrect. The main rhetorical factors to consider when building common ground are tone, language, and appeals. If you do not consider tone, you risk patronizing or offending your audience. 
3. Language
~feedback: That's incorrect. The main rhetorical factors to consider when building common ground are tone, language, and appeals. If you do not consider language, your risk alienating your audience or obfuscating your purpose. 
4. Appeals
~feedback: That's incorrect. The main rhetorical factors to consider when building common ground are tone, language, and appeals. If you do not consider appeals, your argument may be easily ignored by your audience. 

Which of the following would not be considered a discourse community?
~formative
1. A scientist, a politician, a baker, and a murderer who all speak the same language.*
~feedback: That's correct. Even though the scientist, politician, baker, and murderer probably have things in common, their common ground isn't sufficient to be considered a discourse community (any more than speakers of the same language make up a discourse community). 
2. A group of social workers attending a social work conference.
~feedback: That's incorrect. Social workers in general have a shared vocabulary and training, and since they are attending the same conference, they have shared professional interests. 
3. The local bird watching club.
~feedback: That's incorrect. The local bird watching club has shared experience with the birds in the community, and use specialized language to refer to bird sightings. 
4. Faculty members in a sociology department
~feedback: That's incorrect. Faculty members in academic departments usually have similar training, backgrounds, and interests. Though the focus of their research may differ, they share disciplinary common ground. 

Which of the following is a way to build common ground in an argument essay about legislation to eliminate gender-based pay inequities? 
~formative
1. Changing the phrase "militant femi-Nazis" to "proponents of the pay equity legislation"*
~feedback: Correct. Revising language so that it is not hostile is a way to build common ground.
2. Adding more words to meet the length requirements 
~feedback: Incorrect. While this action improve the essay, it is not a way to build common ground.
3. Reorganizing paragraphs to improve the logic of the argument
~feedback: Incorrect. While this action may improve the essay, it is not a way to build common ground.
4. Adding transitions between paragraphs 
~feedback: Incorrect. While this action may improve the essay, it is not a way to build common ground.

True or False: An effective strategy for building common ground in an argument is to add more sources. 
~summative
1. False*
2. True

What is a common feature of an academic discourse community?
~summative
1. Specialized vocabulary*
2. Religious beliefs
3. Skin color
4. Sentence structure 

Reorganizing paragraphs to improve the logic of the argument is not an effective strategy for building common ground because…
~summative
1. A logical argument can still be offensive to an audience. Though reorganizing paragraphs might make the argument more clear, doing so doesn't build common ground.*
2. Arguments that are disorganized or illogical are more convincing to a hostile audience. 
3. Arguments that are unclear are easier to use to deceive an audience that disagrees with the premise.

You are a dietician invited to speak to a meeting of Overeaters Anonymous. What rhetorical approach should you use to build common ground with them? 
~formative
1. You should talk with them in a casual, informal tone, and work to build trust. Explain your purpose for being there without being patronizing. Make sure you use language that a general audience would understand, and work to build your credibility. *
~feedback: Correct. All of these techniques would help build common ground.
2. You should lecture them about their poor choices, and make sure they know you're the authority on their poor choices. Explain that you are there to correct their ways, and give them instructions using formal, technical language. 
~feedback: Incorrect. These actions would likely be seen as an attack, thereby decreasing the argument's persuasiveness and failing to build common ground.
3. You should lie about who you are and infiltrate the group in order to further your own dietetic clinic. You should exaggerate facts and play up your appeals to emotion in order to get the other members of the group to enlist your clinic's services. 
~feedback: Incorrect. These actions would decrease your credibility as a speaker rather than building common ground.

Lisa is a first-year student who is working on a campus project to increase recycling in the fraternity and sorority houses. She has been invited to address the student body government about her ideas. The government has been very reluctant to pass measures in the past that add rules to Greek houses. What is Lisa's best rhetorical approach in addressing the group?
~formative
1. Lisa should devote her energies to arguing that Greek houses haven't have to abide by the same rules as do regular students and that it is time for that to change.
~feedback: Incorrect. Approaching the situation from a negative perspective rather than a positive one is unlikely to win Lisa much support or to help her build common ground.
2. Lisa should criticize members of the government for not caring about the school's carbon footprint and bemoan their reluctance to enact more rules in the past.
~feedback: Incorrect. Approaching the situation from a negative perspective rather than a positive one is unlikely to win Lisa much support or to help her build common ground.
3. Lisa should emphasize the philanthropic aspect of fraternities and sororities and point out that enhanced recycling would give the Greek houses a chance to contribute positively to the community and campus while benefitting everyone in the long term because all students gain from a cleaner environment.*
~feedback: Correct. Lisa can build common ground with both the student government and the Greek houses by highlighting how everyone gains from certain changes. Further, a positive tone is likely to help her cause. 

Marcia is anticipating a difficult conversation with her parents in which she will be asking them to help her buy a car. She jots down a draft of what she might say and decides that the following sentences will be a way to build common ground: "Mom and Dad, I admire both of you so much. I know you both held jobs while you were in college to help out with expenses. You have told me so often how the time management skills you acquired by juggling the demands of work and school were so valuable to you. I would like to follow your lead and try to get a part-time job, too." Do those sentences build common ground?
~formative
True*
~feedback: Correct. By appealing to pathos and ethos ("admire") as well as logos (acquiring time management skills), Marcia is building common ground.
False
~feedback: Incorrect. Think about the ways Marcia appeals to emotion, credibility, and logic.

True or False: The following rhetorical approach would be effective in building common ground with a group of university administrators in your argument against the smoking ban:<p>You research each university administrator's family and find members of their families who smoke. You locate pictures on social media of people close to the administrators smoking, and you plan to use this against them as you make your case that the smoking ban isn't fair. You believe that shaming or embarrassing the audience is the best way to get them on your side.</p>

Dean is a first-year student who is working on a campus project to increase ride-sharing among commuter students. He has been invited to address the student body government about his ideas. The government has been reluctant to pass legislation that addresses parking or transportation issues. What is Dean's best rhetorical approach for making an argument? 
~summative
1. Dean should emphasize the hardship caused by students who commute long distances only to find that there are no parking spots for them. His argument should rely on logos (the number of parking spaces, the distance students drive, the environmental costs of driving around looking for parking) and pathos (students who are exhausted and stressed, students who have to spend too much money on gas).*
2. Dean should berate the student government for their role in destroying the environment. He should shame them by pointing out how pollution comes from their personal vehicles. 
3. Dean should go through each piece of legislation that the student government has passed so far this year and point out flaws. He should argue that passing a ride-sharing bill would be the only way the group could stay relevant on campus. 

Which one of the sentences in the passage below does not build common ground:<p>Mom and Dad, I admire both of you so much. I know you both held jobs while you were in college to help out with expenses. You have told me so often how the time management skills you acquired by juggling the demands of work and school were so valuable to you. It's also clear that you were still able to drink and party while you were working. I would like to follow your lead and try to get a part-time job, too.</p>

~formative
1. Acknowledgement of opposing points of view

~feedback: Incorrect. Writers should use qualifying terms unless they can state their claims absolutely.
3. Omission of facts that support a view opposing your main claim*

Which of the following is not a qualifying term?
~formative
1. Normally
~feedback: Incorrect. Remember that the opposite of a qualifying term is an absolute term, and "normally" isn't absolute.
2. Could
~feedback: Incorrect. The word "could" is a qualifying term because it leaves room for doubt.
3. All*
~feedback: Correct. The word "all" is an absolute term because it leaves no room for exceptions.

Hannah is writing an argument paper on why cosmetic companies should stop testing products on animals. She read a source that provided clear evidence showing how animal testing has saved thousands of human lives because scientists have been able to determine what products might cause illness or death in humans before they are sold to people. Which of the following options below is Hannah's best way to rebut or refute the source?
~formative
1. She should acknowledge that there may be truth to the source's claim but then offer realistic and credible alternatives to animal testing that would still benefit people.*
~feedback: Correct. Remember that you don't have to disprove a claim to rebut or refute it. 
2. She should not include the source in her paper because it goes against her main point and would hurt her claims.
~feedback: Incorrect. Remember that you don't have to disprove a claim to rebut or refute it. 
3. She should include the source in her paper but claim that it is not true because doing so would strengthen her own thesis.
~feedback: Incorrect. Remember that you don't have to disprove a claim to rebut or refute it. Also, it would be dishonest of Hannah to misrepresent a source, even if it presents information that isn't convenient to her argument. 

Sarah is working on her argument paper on why her campus should offer a pet-friendly dorm. Her friend at a different university posted online that she has her cat with her at school, which prompted Sarah to do some research. She found over twenty .edu websites online with pet-friendly housing options, but she couldn't find any numbers suggesting the total number of four-year schools with such policies. She is now working on her section where she is refuting/rebutting claims that pets are a distraction to students, especially in the first year of their post-secondary education, and are a bad idea on campuses. Which of the following is her best option for phrasing in her paper?
~formative
1. Most colleges and universities in America offer pet-friendly living options for students.
~feedback: Incorrect. The word "most" implies at least a majority of schools, and Sarah doesn't have evidence that this is true.
2. Many colleges and universities in America offer pet-friendly living options for students.*
~feedback: Correct. The word "many" is much safer than the other options here because it implies more than a few schools without giving an exact number or implying a majority.
3. Colleges and universities in America offer pet-friendly living options for students.
~feedback: Incorrect. This is tricky. Even though the statement here is technically correct, it is misleading because readers may think the lack of a qualifying word means that "all" colleges and universities offer pet-friendly living options. Words like "many" or "several" make the statement much more precise and honest.

Xavier is revising his argument paper because he received feedback that his coverage of counterargument is insufficient. His thesis statement is that football stadiums in the SEC should be allowed to feature alcohol sales. He just found a credible source with numbers proving that the frequency of fights and arrests is higher at college sporting events where alcohol is sold. The source goes on to suggest that no additional college stadiums should feature alcohol sales because of the findings. Which of the following is the best way for Xavier to incorporate but rebut/refute the source?
~formative
1. Xavier should include the numbers from the source but claim that the study shows mostly examples from schools in the North, so the results don't apply at SEC schools.
~feedback: Incorrect. The results of the study likely have nothing to do with region of the country. Claiming such could hurt Xavier's credibility.
2. Xavier should include the numbers from the source, acknowledging that an increase in drunkenness and rowdy behavior may result from alcohol sales, but suggest the extra revenue could cover increased security and still include large profits for the schools.*
~feedback: Correct. The source is definitely worth including, so Xavier's best bet is to acknowledge and accommodate the information and then rebut/refute the claim about expanding alcohol sales to other campuses.
3. Xavier should not include the source in his paper because the findings of the study are problematic to his own main claim.
~feedback: Incorrect. Excluding valid information from the work just because it differs from his own claim is not going to help Xavier's credibility, and it leaves his paper open to an easy counterargument.

Chase is a first-year student who served in Afghanistan after high school and is now returning to school. He is writing an argument paper claiming that the military should arm active-duty soldiers with a less expensive weapon than the one being used currently. Chase owns several weapons and is quite familiar with the specifications and prices of many models. He knows that lobbyists for one of the government weapons contracts made a strong pitch recently to keep their gun as the standard issue for troops, so he is writing a section rebutting some of the information they presented. Which of the following is his best path?
~summative
1. Chase should rely on his high knowledge of weapons to write the rebuttal/refutation. He has personal experience that will guide him through the argument.
2. Chase's personal experience does not matter in an academic argument. He needs to find other voices to put his thoughts into words.
3. Chase should use his personal knowledge to help him, but he should also check his information and find source material that might assist in making his claims.*

Sean is writing an argument essay claiming that violent games do not cause children to become more aggressive. He is incorporating a source from a journal on adolescent behavior which asserts male children between 9-13 who play violent video games participated in more aggressive acts over a two-month observation period than did male children the same ages who did not play violent video games. Sean has acknowledged the study, but he is now rebutting the source, noting that there isn't much information about the subjects' home lives. Which of the following is the best option for a sentence in his rebuttal?
~summative
1. Though the study reveals some troubling data, the researchers purposely ignored providing information about the children's home lives so that video games looked like the culprit.
2. Though the study reveals some troubling data, the article does not provide complete information on the children's home lives, which may have shed more light into their behavioral patterns.* 
3. Though the study reveals some troubling data, the article was published in an academic journal by liberal researchers who want to ban violent video games. 

Denise has been reading up on vaccinations and how some parents choose not to immunize their children. She just read a source about a town in California that suffered a measles outbreak due to many children in the local school system not being vaccinated. She is incorporating information from this source into her paper to rebut claims from another source that says children who are not vaccinated are safer. Which of the following is the best option for a sentence in her rebuttal?
~summative
1. Children need to be vaccinated because outbreaks may occur within communities if enough people aren't immunized.*
2. Children need to be vaccinated because outbreaks will occur within communities if enough people aren't immunized.
3. Children need to be vaccinated because outbreaks always occur within communities if enough people aren't immunized.

3. The purpose of the flier is candidate advocacy so it is subject to bias and the authority of the information is in question because the source of the statistics is uncited.*
~feedback: Correct. The flier does not meet the criteria of purpose and authority.

~summative
1. The article was written in 2013.
2. The article is related to the paper topic.
3. LeBron James is a professional basketball player, and <em>Sports Illustrated</em> is a nationally-recognized sports magazine.*

Which of the following is the best indicator that your online source has currency?
~formative
1. There is a date of two months ago on the part of the information you want to use.*
~feedback: Correct. Unless you were researching something extremely recent and rapidly changing, information that is about two months old is usually very recent.
2. There is information on the front page that the website was founded in 2017.
~feedback: Incorrect. When the website was founded usually wouldn't have any bearing on particular pieces of information you may need to cite. 
3. There is no date listed on your website.
~feedback: Incorrect. More reliable sources will usually have date information, even if it is just a year.

You are researching your paper topic, which is about how the majority of Americans approve of gay marriage, when you come across an article on the online publication HuffPost dated four months ago with statistics from a survey conducted by the Gallup Poll. Which of the following best describes how you should evaluate this source?
~formative
1. You should feel free to use the numbers after you have verified them to make sure nothing was used out of context.*
~feedback: Correct. Even if some people feel like a source may contain bias, if you can verify information in multiple places and determine that it is reliable, you should feel comfortable using it.
2. You should skip using this source because there is no print version of the HuffPost.
~feedback: Incorrect. Sources do not need to be available in print to be accurate or reliable.
3. You should avoid using this source because the information is from four months ago.
~feedback: Incorrect. Four months is not a long time when dealing with huge cultural and social issues where opinions may take long periods of time to shift. The information still has plenty of currency, and you should use it if it helps your point. 

You are researching your paper on teenage pregnancy and you find a .gov website that has statistics on which states have the highest teen pregnancies per capita. Which of the following best describes how you should evaluate this source?
~formative
1. You should feel free to use the statistics in your paper after you have tried to verify them to make sure they sound accurate and reliable. *
~feedback: Correct. Government websites usually provide objective data and information collected from knowledgeable people with authority in their areas.
2. You should not use the source until you can verify the information in a print source.
~feedback: Incorrect. Though you always want to try to verify information, it does not need to come from a print source to be accurate and reliable.
3. You should not use this source because government websites are unreliable.
~feedback: Incorrect. Government websites are generally great places to go to ensure authority and accuracy because people need certain levels of expertise to post.

You are researching a paper on how often Hollywood casts minorities in starring roles when you come across the online blog of a famous director who writes about how he loves to cast Latina women in powerful roles. Which of the following best describes how you should evaluate this source?
~summative
1. You should use the information in your paper because the director is an authority in this area.*
2. You should not use the source because blogs are not reliable sources.
3. You should not use the source because it is not relevant enough to your topic.

You are researching a paper on how more concussions are being diagnosed in college football each year when you find a source from ESPN on the number of total season-ending injuries sustained two season ago. After you apply the CRAAP analysis, your best choice is:
~summative
1. You should not use the source because total injuries is far broader than concussions, so the source may not be relevant.*
2. You should not use the source because it is not current enough.
3. You should not use the source because ESPN is not an authority on college football.

You are researching a paper on sanctuary cities when you find a website with an article written by a Sociology professor. The article has numbers on how sanctuary cities have fewer violent crimes than non-sanctuary cities. When you research the site further by looking up who hosts the site, you discover that it is an openly left-leaning organization. After you apply the CRAAP analysis, your best choice is:
~summative
1. Try to find the information somewhere that might be considered more objective so that your readers don't assume bias.*
2. Use the information in your paper. Statistics are numbers and are thus objective.
3. Avoid using the information in your paper because the author lacks authority. 

You are writing a paper on how modern politicians interpret a constitution written by citizens well over 200 years ago when you encounter a state senator's website with a quote by Thomas Jefferson. The site doesn't provide a citation for the Jefferson quote, but you think it fits your work perfectly. After you apply the CRAAP analysis, your best choice is:
~summative
1. Avoid using the quotation unless you can verify it and properly cite it.*
2. Use the quotation and cite the senator's website as the source.
3. Avoid using the quotation because of problems with currency. 

A website ranking colleges and universities on affordability would be a good source in your paper about which majors students should seek out in the next ten years to ensure employment and good pay.
~summative
1. False*
2. True

A small, local publication puts out a weekly online-only newspaper. The latest issue features profiles and interviews with the two candidates for the open state representative position. This would make a good source for your paper on local elections.
~summative
1. True*
2. False

An online article from five years ago on the trendiest fashion styles for young men would make for a current source.

While studying recent breakthroughs in autism research, James finds a news clip from 1978 in which a doctor is interviewed about his research about the causes of autism. This is a poor source for James to use because…
~formative
1. Currency is important to James's research, and an interview from 1978 would not provide current information about research into the causes of autism.*
~feedback: That's correct. Unless James was researching the changes in beliefs about the causes of autism, a source this old would not be useful. 
2. The doctor being interviewed is not an authority on the subject of autism. 
~feedback: That's incorrect. Whether the doctor is an authority in 1978 is besides the point: the source is too old to use for James's research. 
3. The source is irrelevant to the subject of James's research.
~feedback: That's incorrect. James is studying recent breakthroughs in autism research. This would be a useful source if it were current. 

Which of these examples is a source with authority to address the use of fidget spinners as a coping tool for ADHD patients?
~formative
1. Dr. JoAnn Comey, a pediatrician with several publications in child psychiatry journals, explains why ADHD patients can use objects like fidget spinners to reduce their anxiety in an informational video for a psychiatrist's office.*
~feedback: That's correct. Dr. Comey has the authority to speak on this subject because of her expertise and her background.
2. John T. McBlytheville, the president and C.E.O of Fidgets 4 U, Inc., claims in a video advertisement that his fidget spinners can reduce anxiety in children with ADHD by 98%. 
~feedback: That's incorrect. Though Mr. McBlytheville has expertise about fidget spinners, he also has a bias: he wants to sell his products. He also does not have the background to make statements about psychological efficacy. 
3. SuperDadAlexander, a popular YouTube user, posts a video of his child, Sue Ann Alexander (who has a temper and an ADHD diagnosis) destroying the dining room at Golden Corral. When she is given a fidget spinner, she sits down and quietly returns to her pudding with the fidget spinner in hand.
~feedback: That's incorrect. Anecdotal experience is not sufficient evidence for authority. There are too many other variables at play in this source for it to be considered credible. 

True or False: A podcast about grave robbers in Woolsey, Georgia could be a good source to use for a research project about the history of grave robbery in the American South. 
~formative
1. True*
~feedback: That's correct. This podcast could provide relevant information for the research project, especially if it discusses historical context.
2. False
~feedback: That's incorrect. Though you can't be certain of its usefulness, it's very clear that the source is relevant to the research project. 

Why is currency important for a multimedia source?
~summative
1. Multimedia sources can become outdated quickly, so it is important to check the publication date when determining a source's relevance.*
2. Newer sources are alway better than older sources, regardless of the topic. 
3. Multimedia sources must be valued in specific denominations of currency in order to be valid for research. 

A vlog by YouTuber SuperDadAlexander is a good source to learn about parenting techniques just because he has a high view count. 
~summative
1. False*
2. True

Which of the following would be a bad multimedia source to use in a paper about alcoholism on college campuses?
~summative
1. An Instagram video collection from the TotalFratMove account showcasing the most popular drinking-related videos of the year.*
2. A PSA from the University's health department about the dangers of alcohol abuse by college students. 
3. A documentary on Netflix about alcoholism on college campuses. 

Which answer is a fair evaluation of this statement: I am writing a research paper about the history of grave robbing in Georgia. I come across a podcast by a group of historians from Fayette County, Georgia about grave robbing in Woolsey, Georgia in the 1990s. This is an excellent source to use for my paper. 
~summative
1. This is sound reasoning, because the authors of the podcast have some authority on the subject, it is current to your research topic (historical events), and there is likely not a better source that explains grave robbing in Woolsey in the 1990s. *
2. This is poor reasoning. Podcasts are never reputable sources of information because they are usually free and can be accessed from mobile devices. Real historians would only share their knowledge in peer-reviewed journal articles.
3. This is sound reasoning because people from Fayette County, Georgia are experts about what happened in Woolsey in the 1990s.

<p>Read the passage below and answer the following questions about using sources appropriately.</p><p>In the article, "The Loneliness of the Interconnected," Charles Seife argues that people are becoming more and more isolated in our increasingly interconnected world and, furthermore, that bits and pieces of our delicate mental structure are withered away as we increasingly rely on the internet as our source of information. According to Selfe, this mental decay leaves us with some opinions "as firm as bedrock, and just as difficult to remove" (290).As an example of this phenomenon, Seife describes how, in the 1950s, psychologist Leon Festinger sought to research the point at which this crisis occurs. He contacted a woman by the name of Dorothy Martin who was the leader of a small cult in Chicago. Martin believed that she was writing letters under the command of Clarion, a distant planet. She had concrete belief that Chicago would be wiped out and that the United States would be submerged under water from a great flood on the morning of December 21, 1955. Her salvation? A spaceman, assumed to be a Clarion, would visit Dorothy and her followers hours before the disaster, whisking them away on a spaceship to safety. This bizarre and radical belief was only strengthened when the calamity never arose. The cult members convinced themselves that the Clarions managed to stop the destruction from happening (Seife 290-91).

### 10.2.2 Evaluate application of paraphrase, summary, and quotation
Evaluate application of paraphrase, summary, and quotation
~ 544089b6-4d80-443d-9f75-315ffc77d362

<p>A classmate comes to you for advice on an essay she has written. The instructor told her to revise the paper and use fewer direct quotations in the next draft. However, your classmate doesn't want to lose the details from the source she is citing. You advise her to:</p>
~formative
1. Paraphrase and cite the significant parts of the article.*
~feedback: That's right! Concise, clear paraphrase ensures that more of the paper is in the classmate's own voice. 
2. Put all the quotations into her own words and add new details.
~feedback: That's incorrect. Some direct quotations may be necessary, and there is more to paraphrasing than simply changing the words. 
3. Summarize and cite the entire article.
~feedback: That's incorrect. Summaries use fewer details than paraphrases or direct quotations. 

<p>Read the following passage and a paraphrase of it. How would you evaluate the paraphrase?</p><p>Original: "There is, in fact, a nearly universally accepted logical and rhetorical structure to mathematical exposition. For over two millennia serious mathematics has been presented following a format of definition-theorem-proof. Euclid's <em>Elements</em> from circa 300 BC codified this mode of presentation which, with minor variations in style, is still used today in journal articles and advanced texts" (Jamison 46)"</p><p>Paraphrase: Mathematical exposition has a galactically believed rhetorical and logical foundation. For over two thousand years, difficult mathematics has been shown to adhere to a format of definition-theorem-proof. Euclid wrote <em>Elements</em> in 300 BC and talked about this method of math that math professors still write about these days in academic research. (Jamison 46)</p>
~formative
1. This is not a good paraphrase. It follows the word order of the original source too closely and merely changes the author's words to their synonyms. The paraphrase is actually less clear than the original text. *
~feedback: Correct! 
2. This is a good paraphrase. It changes all the words from the original text and does not plagiarize the author's ideas. It is also strong because it is equal in length to the original. 
~feedback: That's incorrect. Paraphrase should make the content clearer than the original text and simply choosing synonyms of the author's words may change the meaning of the passage. 
3. This is not a good paraphrase. It does not add the writer's opinions and argument to the author's original claim. 
~feedback: That's incorrect. A paraphrase should not change the meaning of the author's original text. 


Which of the following is an appropriate use of summary?
~formative
1. As part of your research paper, you are writing an annotated bibliography of 5 sources. Each of your sources is between 15 and 20 pages, and you write five sentences for each one that describe the author's key points. *
~feedback: Correct! 
2. You are assigned to write a critical review of a book. Your approach is to write the "SparkNotes" version of the book, condensing each chapter by about 80%. You are careful not to make any new claims about the book. 
~feedback: That's incorrect. A <en>critical</em> book review should contain both summary and your own claims and evaluation of the text. 
3. Your research paper should include citations from at least 5 sources. You do not have time to read the fifth article to find a specific passage to paraphrase or quote. Instead, you simply write about the article generally based on what the abstract says. 
~feedback: That's incorrect. Summary is not a useful shortcut, and you may miss important nuances if you don't read the full source. 

<p>What is the best advice you could offer your classmate for paraphrasing the following quote?</p><p>"There are surprisingly few methods of causing something to move. With a couple of exceptions, everything starts out going around and around, and then that circular motion gets turned into some other path as needed. That being said, there is often some other thing you might want your robot to do that isn't, strictly speaking, movement related, and all that goes into actuation" (Geiger).</p>
~summative
1. Start by putting the thesis into your own words; then list out the main ideas from the quote. Use quotation marks and cite the source if you borrow any phrasing. Expect your paraphrase to be about as long as the original.*
2. Start by identifying the thesis statement. Then make sure that you get only the main ideas, so you can keep this really short. Don't use any words from the original.
3. Start by putting the thesis into your own words; then give your interpretation of the material. Highlight the points you find most interesting. Add quotes and citations when you make comments.

<p>Which of the following is a good paraphrase of the following passage? </p><p>"The third feature that distinguishes mathematical from ordinary language, one which causes enormous difficulties for students, is its precision. Ordinary speech is full of ambiguities, innuendoes, hidden agendas, and unspoken cultural assumptions" (Jameson 47)."
~summative
1. Its precision distinguishes mathematical language from everyday conversation. This feature is very challenging to students. Everyday conversation is full of nuance, metaphor, bias, and cultural assumption, while mathematical language avoids these. *
2. Students have a hard time with the precision of math articles. They are used to talking in slang, while as math is supposed to be boring and dry. 
3. This quotation should not be paraphrased because the idea it expresses is already as clear as it can be. 

Which of the following is <strong>not</strong> an appropriate use of summary? 
~summative 
1. You are assigned to write an argument about the cultural impact of a short story. You write a paper simply condensing the story to its main ideas and removing extra details without making a new claim.* 
2. You are writing an annotated bibliography of 5 article for your final research paper. Each of your articles is between 10 and 15 pages, and you write six sentences for each one that describe the author's key points.
3. For your science class, you are assigned to write a concise lab report documenting your experiment. You write a short paragraph including the steps you undertook and then briefly describe the results.

<p>Identify the error in the following citation:</p><p>Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin. <emRemediation: Understanding New Media.</em> Cambridge: MIT Press, 1999.</p>
~formative
1. The word order of the author's name should be "Bolter, Jay David."*
~feedback: That's correct. Because the works cited page is alphabetical by author last name, the last name should come first in the citation. 
2. Understanding New Media should be underlined.
~feedback. Incorrect. According to the most recent MLA style guide, titles of books and periodicals should be italicized. 
3.  The city of publication should come after the name of the published (MIT Press, Cambridge). 
~feedback: Incorrect: The city of publication always comes first.
4. There is nothing wrong with this citation.
~feedback: Incorrect. Take a look at the citation's word order.

~formative
1. EBSCOHost is the name of a database, not a journal. Journal articles can be accessed by many different databases, but without the title of the journal, a reader may have a hard time finding the original article.* 
2. The year of publication, 2015, should come after the author's name in order for the citation to have correct MLA style. 
3. The author "et al" should come before "Hopmann, David N." because authors should be listed alphabetically. 
4. There is nothing wrong with this citation. 

<p>Does the citation below have an error? If so, how does the error take away from the meaning of the citation?</p><p>"Do Citizens (not Police Officers) with Guns Ever Stop Mass Shootings?" The Washington Post., n.d. Web. 03 Nov. 2016.</p>
~formative
1. The error is n.d., signifying "no date." The Washington Post is a daily newspaper, and newspaper articles will always be associated with a date. The date of publication is important in news articles because they are time-sensitive.*
2. The error is that "Washington Post" should not be italicized.  Titles of full-length works, like newspapers, should be in quotation marks.  This distinction is important because readers may need to know what type of publication this article comes from.
3. The error is no author is listed.  All newspaper articles list authors.  Without knowing the author, it would be difficult to find the article.
4. There is nothing wrong with this citation.

<p>Does the citation below have an error? If so, how does the error take away from the meaning of the citation?</p><p>Professor of Economics, Rhodes University, Snow, Jen. "Why Art and Culture Contribute More to an Economy than Growth and Jobs." The Conversation. N.p., 19 Jan. 2016. Web. 28 Oct. 2016.</p>
~formative
1. The error is in the author's name. The author's title, Professor of Economics at Rhodes University, should not appear in the Works Cited entry.  The author's name should appear first in the entry because that ensures that the source is easily searchable. In addition, knowing the author's title may not be relevant as, for instance, the author may have moved on to a new position.*
2. The error is in the order.  The title of the publication should come before the title of the article.  This is important because most databases search by publication rather than title.
3. The error is in the punctuation.  There should be a comma, not a period, after the author's first name.  This is important because the author has ownership of the article and the comma identifies that ownership.
4. There is nothing wrong with this citation.

Which citation mistakenly lists the database an article was found in instead of the journal?

Effective integration of source material builds credibility in each of the following ways except:
~formative
1. Length of the source material adds to the word count.*
~feedback: Correct.  Length is not a marker of credibility.
2. Evidence adds to the argument's persuasiveness.
~feedback: Incorrect.  Evidence adds to the argument's persuasiveness, thereby building credibility.
3. Signal phrase highlights the reputation and qualifications of the source.
~feedback: Incorrect.  Signal phrases highlight the source's reputation and qualifications, thereby building credibility. 
4. Citation demonstrates trustworthiness of the writer.
~feedback: Incorrect.  Citation demonstrates the writer's trustworthiness, thereby building credibility.
  
Effective integration of source material builds credibility in each of the following ways except:
~formative
1. Source material is substituted for the writer's arguments.*
~feedback: Correct.  Source material supports a writer's arguments rather than substituting for the writer's arguments.  If the source material takes the place of the writer's own ideas and arguments, it diminishes the writer's credibility.
2. Explanation of relevance of the source material to the writer's argument.
~feedback: Incorrect.  Explanation of the relevance of the source material to the writer's argument demonstrates the writer's critical thinking and reasoning, thereby enhancing his or her credibility.
3. Evidence adds to the argument's persuasiveness.
~feedback: Incorrect.  Evidence adds to the argument's persuasiveness, thereby enhancing credibility.
4. Signal phrase highlights the reputation and qualifications of the source.
~feedback: Incorrect.  Signal phrases highlight the source's reputation and qualifications, thereby enhancing credibility.

One way effective integration of source material builds credibility is by demonstrating the relevance of the material to the writer's argument.
~formative
1. True*
~feedback: Correct.  By demonstrating the relevance of the source material to the argument, the writer demonstrates his or her critical thinking and reasoning skills, thereby building his or her credibility.
2. False
~feedback: Incorrect.  By demonstrating the relevance of the source material to the argument, the writer demonstrates his or her critical thinking and reasoning skills, thereby building his or her credibility.

One way effective integration of source material builds credibility is by including a signal phrase.
~summative
1. True*
~feedback: Correct.  A signal phrase highlights the reputation and qualifications of the source and builds credibility.
2. False
~feedback: Incorrect.  A signal phrase highlights the reputation and qualifications of the source and builds credibility.

One way effective integration of source material builds credibility is by increasing the length of the paper.
~summative
1. True
~feedback: Incorrect. Adding length to a paper does not necessarily increase credibility.
2. False*
~feedback: Correct.  Adding length to a paper does not necessarily increase credibility.

One way effective integration of source material builds credibility is by providing evidence to support the writer's argument.
~summative
1. True*
~feedback: Correct. Evidence from source material supports the writer's argument making it more persuasive and credible.
2. False
~feedback: Incorrect.  Evidence from source material supports the writer's argument making it more persuasive and credible.

Including a source's credentials, such as Harvard Distinguished Professor, in the first reference to a source is an example of:
~formative
1. Signal phrase highlighting the reputation and qualifications of the source.*
~feedback: Correct.  By highlighting the reputation and qualifications of a source through a signal phrase, the writer builds the credibility of the source.
2. Evidence adding to the argument's persuasiveness.
~feedback: Incorrect.  Evidence is the source material itself, not the source's credentials.
3. Citation demonstrating the trustworthiness of the writer.
~feedback: Incorrect.  Citation is the bibliographic information for the source, not the source's credentials.
4. Relevance of the source to the writer's argument
~feedback: Incorrect.  Relevance is the way the source material is related to the writer's argument, not the source's credentials.

Including reference information which helps the reader easily find the source is an example of:
~formative
1. Citation demonstrating the trustworthiness of the writer.*
~feedback: Correct.  By providing accurate, complete citation of a source, the writer demonstrates his or her trustworthiness.
2. Signal phrase highlighting the reputation and qualifications of the source.
~feedback: Incorrect.  A signal phrase is an introduction to the source material, not reference information.
3. Evidence adding to the argument's persuasiveness.
~feedback: Incorrect.  Evidence adding to the argument's persuasiveness is the source material itself, not the reference information.
4. Relevance of the source to the writer's argument.
~feedback: Incorrect.  Explaining the relevance of the source to the writer's argument is how the writer demonstrates his or her critical thinking and reasoning, not reference information.

Explaining how the source material supports the writer's point is an example of:
~formative
1. Relevance of the source to the writer's argument.*
~feedback: Correct.  By explaining the relevance of the source to the argument, a writer demonstrates critical thinking and reasoning, thereby building credibility.
2. Citation demonstrating the trustworthiness of the writer.
~feedback: Incorrect.  Citation is providing accurate, complete bibliographical information for a source, not explaining how the source material is related to the writer's point.
3. Evidence adding to the argument's persuasiveness.
~feedback: Incorrect.  Evidence is material from the source, not the writer's explanation of that material's relevance to his or her point.
4. Signal phrase highlighting the reputation and qualifications of the source.
~feedback: Incorrect.  A signal phrase introduces source material rather than explaining its relevance to the writer's point.

Integrating statistics from the National Institutes of Health about the high teenage pregnancy rate into a paragraph arguing for greater access to birth control is an example of:
~summative
1. Evidence adding to the argument's persuasiveness.*
// ~feedback: Correct.  Integrating supporting evidence, such as statistics from a reliable source, can improve the persuasiveness of a writer's argument, thereby building credibility of the argument.
2. Signal phrase highlighting the reputation and qualifications of the source.
//~feedback: Incorrect.  A signal phrase is an introduction to source material, not the source material itself.
3. Relevance of the source to the writer's argument.
// ~feedback: Incorrect.  A writer explains the relevance of the source material to his or her point after he or she has integrated the source material.
4. Citation demonstrating the trustworthiness of the writer.
//~feedback: Incorrect.  Citation of the source directs the reader to the location of the source.  It is not the source material itself.

A signal phrase differs from evidence because it introduces the evidence and highlights the source's reputation and qualifications.
~summative
1. True*
// ~feedback: Correct.  The signal phrase is the introduction to the evidence. The evidence is the material from the source that the writer integrates to support his or her point.
2. False
//~feedback: Incorrect.  The signal phrase is the introduction to the evidence. The evidence is the material from the source that the writer integrates to support his or her point.

Integrating evidence from a source is the same as relating the source to the writer's argument.
~summative
1. True
// ~feedback: Incorrect.  Evidence is the source material.  In relating the source material to the writer's argument, the writer explains how the evidence supports his or her own thinking, thereby demonstrating critical thinking and building his or her credibility.  These are two separate strategies.
