## 8.4 Evaluate strategies for rebuttal and refutation of counter-argument

### 8.4.1 Recognize strategies for rebuttal and refutation of counter argument

Which of the following is not normally a part of rebuttal/refutation in an academic argument?
~formative
1. Acknowledgement of opposing points of view
~feedback: Incorrect. Writers wanting to rebut or refute claims need to acknowledge them first.
2. Use of qualifying terms if necessary
~feedback: Incorrect. Writers should use qualifying terms unless they can state their claims absolutely.
3. Omission of facts that support a view opposing your main claim*
~feedback: Correct. Writers should include facts that support views opposing their claim because it helps to be thorough in accurately representing those views in order to better rebut/refute them.
 
Which of the following is not a qualifying term?
~formative
1. Normally
~feedback: Incorrect. Remember that the opposite of a qualifying term is an absolute term, and “normally” isn’t absolute.
2. Could
~feedback: Incorrect. The word “could” is a qualifying term because it leaves room for doubt.
3. All*
~feedback: Correct. The word “all” is an absolute term because it leaves no room for exceptions.
 
Which of the following is a key component of rebuttal/refutation?
~formative
1. Using a tone that doesn’t offend readers, even those who disagree with your claim*
~feedback: Correct. Using a respectful tone is an important part of building your credibility as a writer.
2. Making sure you win the argument using any means necessary
~feedback: Incorrect. Academic argument is not about winning or losing. It is about thorough research and reasoned claims.
3. Using better sources than the ones you use to present the counterargument
~feedback: Incorrect. You want to use quality sources to present all perspectives in your argument.

Hannah is writing an argument paper on why cosmetic companies should stop testing products on animals. She read a source that provided clear evidence showing how animal testing has saved thousands of human lives because scientists have been able to determine what products might cause illness or death in humans before they are sold to people. Which of the following options below is Hannah’s best way to rebut or refute the source?
~formative
1. She should acknowledge that there may be truth to the source’s claim but then offer realistic and credible alternatives to animal testing that would still benefit people.*
~feedback: Correct. Remember that you don’t have to disprove a claim to rebut or refute it.   
2. She should not include the source in her paper because it goes against her main point and would hurt her claims.
~feedback: Incorrect. Remember that you don’t have to disprove a claim to rebut or refute it. 
3. She should include the source in her paper but claim that it is not true because doing so would strengthen her own thesis.
~feedback: Incorrect. Remember that you don’t have to disprove a claim to rebut or refute it. Also, it would be dishonest of Hannah to misrepresent a source, even if it presents information that isn’t convenient to her argument. 
 
Sarah is working on her argument paper on why her campus should offer a pet-friendly dorm. Her friend at a different university posted online that she has her cat with her at school, which prompted Sarah to do some research. She found over twenty .edu websites online with pet-friendly housing options, but she couldn’t find any numbers suggesting the total number of four-year schools with such policies. She is now working on her section where she is refuting/rebutting claims that pets are a distraction to students, especially in the first year of their post-secondary education, and are a bad idea on campuses. Which of the following is her best option for phrasing in her paper?
~formative
1. Most colleges and universities in America offer pet-friendly living options for students.
~feedback: Incorrect. The word “most” implies at least a majority of schools, and Sarah doesn’t have evidence that this is true.
2. Many colleges and universities in America offer pet-friendly living options for students.*
~feedback: Correct. The word “many” is much safer than the other options here because it implies more than a few schools without giving an exact number or implying a majority.
3. Colleges and universities in America offer pet-friendly living options for students.
~feedback: Incorrect. This is tricky. Even though the statement here is technically correct, it is misleading because readers may think the lack of a qualifying word means that “all” colleges and universities offer pet-friendly living options. Words like “many” or “several” make the statement much more precise and honest.
 
Xavier is revising his argument paper because he received feedback that his coverage of counterargument is insufficient. His thesis statement is that football stadiums in the SEC should be allowed to feature alcohol sales. He just found a credible source with numbers proving that the frequency of fights and arrests is higher at college sporting events where alcohol is sold. The source goes on to suggest that no additional college stadiums should feature alcohol sales because of the findings. Which of the following is the best way for Xavier to incorporate but rebut/refute the source?
~formative
1. Xavier should include the numbers from the source but claim that the study shows mostly examples from schools in the North, so the results don’t apply at SEC schools.
~feedback: Incorrect. The results of the study likely have nothing to do with region of the country. Claiming such could hurt Xavier’s credibility.
2. Xavier should include the numbers from the source, acknowledging that an increase in drunkenness and rowdy behavior may result from alcohol sales, but suggest the extra revenue could cover increased security and still include large profits for the schools.*
~feedback: Correct. The source is definitely worth including, so Xavier’s best bet is to acknowledge and accommodate the information and then rebut/refute the claim about expanding alcohol sales to other campuses.
3. Xavier should not include the source in his paper because the findings of the study are problematic to his own main claim.
~feedback: Incorrect. Excluding valid information from the work just because it differs from his own claim is not going to help Xavier’s credibility, and it leaves his paper open to an easy counterargument.
