### 8.3.2 Evaluate rhetorical approaches to building common ground

True or False: The following rhetorical approach would be effective in building common ground with a group of university administrators in your argument against the smoking ban:<p>You research each university administrator’s family and find members of their families who smoke. You locate pictures on social media of people close to the administrators smoking, and you plan to use this against them as you make your case that the smoking ban isn’t fair. You believe that shaming or embarrassing the audience is the best way to get them on your side.</p>

Dean is a first-year student who is working on a campus project to increase ride-sharing among commuter students. He has been invited to address the student body government about his ideas. The government has been reluctant to pass legislation that addresses parking or transportation issues. What is Dean’s best rhetorical approach for making an argument? 
~summative
1. Dean should emphasize the hardship caused by students who commute long distances only to find that there are no parking spots for them. His argument should rely on logos (the number of parking spaces, the distance students drive, the environmental costs of driving around looking for parking) and pathos (students who are exhausted and stressed, students who have to spend too much money on gas).*
2. Dean should berate the student government for their role in destroying the environment. He should shame them by pointing out how pollution comes from their personal vehicles. 
3. Dean should go through each piece of legislation that the student government has passed so far this year and point out flaws. He should argue that passing a ride-sharing bill would be the only way the group could stay relevant on campus.
