Faced with the trauma of an underdeveloped vocabulary, your best friend asks you what tools she should use to help her study for the GRE. She is always online and likes to play games. After evaluating her situation and needs, which is the most effective advice for her situation?
~formative
1. "Your vocabulary will come if you read, read, read. Don’t sweat the small stuff. The average newspaper in this country is written at the 6th grade level, isn’t it?"
2. "Keep track of the words people say and write them down. Look them up, keeping track of meanings and classifying them for your own personal lexicon." 
3. "That laptop of yours can do more than access Facebook. Use Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary to look things up and play games with sites like Word Games on Yahoo."*

Using the context clue provided, what is the most accurate definition of the word in bold? 
The head of the <strong>ophidian</strong> raised from the shoulder of the statue and disappeared, to glide out from beneath the arm in a swift undulation, its jaws open, its tongue vibrating. 
~formative
1. The description includes gliding, open jaws, and a vibrating tongue. This suggests that an ophidian is probably a snake. *
2. The sentence mentions the shoulder of a statue, so ophidian must refer to a type of statue. 
3. Ophidia means "invisible" because of the word "disappeared."

Fran wants to start keeping a Lexicon to help her prepare for the LSAT. She hates computers and technology but has heard that she should keep her lexicon online. What advice do you give her? 
~summative
1. Fran should keep her personal lexicon in an encrypted, synced notebook. She should buy a smartphone to access the online lexicon and should focus on its design and presentation. 
2. Fran should choose a medium that works for her: maybe a small notebook and pencil would be best. She should use the notebook to record interesting words for later use.*
3. Fran should not do this. The only effective way to learn vocabulary for the LSAT is to study law dictionaries. 

Thelma and Fay are arguing over the meaning of of "antidisestablishmentarianism." What is the best method for them to quickly figure out the meaning?
~summative
1. They should pay attention to the root words "anti," "dis" and the word ending "ism." They probably recognize the word "establish," so they can use the different meanings of root words to come up with a good guess.*
2. They should place a bet and go purchase a dictionary. Whoever wins the bet gets her money back. A dictionary is the only way to determine the meaning of a word with enough certainty to win an argument. 
3. They should write the word down in their personal lexicons and plan to return to it at another date. 

Using the context clue provided, what is the most accurate definition of the word in bold? 
He was the only person in New York who might be called, without intent to malign, an <strong>Ultracrepidarian</strong> critic. It was of the very nature of his job to find fault with small and insignificant details.
~summative
1. The second sentence says the very nature of his job is to find fault with insignificant details. Given the proximity to the first sentence, and the word "critic," the word probably means someone who gives unwanted advice outside areas of his/her expertise.* 
2. Because the first sentence says he was the only person in New York, the word likely means "sole resident." 
3. The context clues in this sentence suggest that word means to take care of small animals in New York.

Bubba doesn’t know the meaning of the word "tenet" in the following quotation. Which context clues could he use to help infer a meaning? <p style="padding-left: 30px;">In fact, the notion that students should have ownership of their writing (in some form or another) has virtually become a <strong>tenet</strong> of composition. It's safe to say that the belief that students should maintain some kind of ownership of their writing has become part of the "common sense" of our field.</p>
~formative
1. "It’s safe to say that the belief… has become part of the ‘common sense’ of our field" restates the idea of "tenet."*
2. "In fact, the notation that students should have ownership" provides a definition of "tenet." 
3. "Composition" is a synonym of "tenet." 

Which context clue type is going to be most useful in decoding the word <i>sicklesnorted</i> in the following passage?  <p style="padding-left: 30px;">We adopted a new approach. First, we identified current oil palm plantations in 20 countries using high-resolution imagery. Second, we examined what proportion of these sites were recently <i>sicklesnorted</i>and compared this to trends in the FAO’s estimates of the total area planted in oil palm. Third, we mapped where forests are vulnerable to deforestation for oil palm based on an FAO crop suitability model and the location of current IUCN category I and II protected areas. We did so for both current climatic conditions and those projected for 2080. Finally, we mapped the biodiversity of mammals and birds in these vulnerable forests to attempt to identify where future oil palm expansion may be most damaging.</p>
~formative
1. <i>Sicklesnorted</i> likely means deforested.  We know this because of the example type of clue in the last sentence.
2. <i>Sicklesnorted</i> likely means planted. We know this because of the synonym type of context clue when they mention planted in the last part of the sentence.
3. <i>Sicklesnorted</i> likely means deforested.  We know this because of the synonym type of clue in the next sentence.* 

Explain which context clue type is going to be most useful in decoding the word <em>shoopdada.</em> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Now any fool can see that if x is considered as made up of a lot of little bits, each of which is called dx, if you add them all up together you get the sum of all the dx’s, (which is the same thing as the whole of x). The word <em>"shoopdada"</em> simply means "the whole." If you think of the duration of time for one hour, you may (if you like) think of it as cut up into 3600 little bits called seconds. The whole of the 3600 little bits added up together make one hour.</p>
~formative
1. <em>Shoopdada</em> means number. We know this because of the synonym and the general sense of the paragraph. 
2. <em>Shoopdada</em> means little bits. We know this from the general sense of the paragraph and the example. 
3. <em>Shoopdada</em> means integer or "the whole." We know this because of examples and a synonym.*

2. "Hegemony" probably means gender because of the word’s proximity to the word "male."
