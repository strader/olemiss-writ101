// Excelsior OWL question
Which type of context clue is being used in the following passage? <p><strong>Parallax</strong> is becoming a common effect used in mobile device screens. <em>With this effect,</em> the direction of objects on the screen appears to shift depending on the position of the viewer.</p>
1. Adjacent Clue* 
~feedback: That's correct. Even if you don't know what <strong>parallax</strong> is, if you keep reading you can determine its meaning from the rest of the passage. 
2. Definition Clue
~feedback: That's not correct. The passage doesn't explicitly define <strong>parallax</strong>. We can only determine the meaning from the proximity of other words and phrases.
3. Example Clue
~feedback: That's not correct. Though this passage explains how  <strong>parallax</strong> works, it doesn't provide an actual example of the effect. 

Which type of context clue is being used in the following passage? 
<p><strong>Obfuscation</strong>, <em>or</em> intentionally making things difficult to understand, was Senator Biddy's main strategy in the agriculture committee.
1. Definition Clue*
~feedback: That's correct. The appositive after <em>or</em> provides an informal definition for the word. You could switch the word order, making "obfuscation" the appositive, and the sentence would still make sense. 
2. Synonym Clue
~feedback: That's not correct.  Synonyms typically mean the same thing as the original word, but don't necessarily break it down any more. A synonym of <p><strong>obfuscation</strong> might be <em>over-complication</em>.
3. Experience Clue
~feedback: That's not correct. Nothing in this passage draws on personal experiences to help infer meaning. 

// quote origin: Richard F. Shepard, "Despite the Heat Summer in the City Has Always Been An Outdoor Affair," New York Times, July 8, 1990 
Using the context clue provided, what is the most accurate definition of the word in bold? <p>Water and ice go to extremes in <strong>estival</strong> New York. Water consumption in summer averages 1.6 billion gallons a day, as against 1.2 billion in winter.</p>
1. pertaining or appropriate to summer*
~feedback: That's correct. You can infer from the adjacent sentence that this passage is referring to water consumption in summer, so it's a safe bet that <strong>estival</strong> has something to do with summer. 
2. Thirst or thirstiness
~feedback: That's not correct. Though the second sentence does deal with water consumption, it's clearly making a comparison between two seasons, winter and summer. 
3. Non-free festival
~feedback: That's not correct. Though the word may have a similar root to "festival," nothing in this passage suggests any connection to festivals or their cost. 

Using the context clue provided, what is the most accurate definition of the word in bold? 
<p>Adults born in the 1980s have almost a <strong>prelapsarian</strong> nostalgia for the <em>Oregon Trail</em> game, with it's straight-forward game play and its association with elementary school. </p>
1. characteristic of or pertaining to any innocent or carefree period* 
~feedback: That's correct. This passage uses examples of personal experience to provide context for the word <strong>prelapsarian.</strong>
2. Scholarly or based on academic work
~feedback: That's not correct. Though <em>Oregon Trail</em> is associated with school, this passage isn't about its relationship to academia. 
3. Pre-running stretching exercises
~feedback: That's not correct. The root of this word is "lapse," not "lap," so it has nothing to do with running.

Based on what you learned in the last section, what is the correct definition of <strong>voracious</strong>?
1. exceedingly eager or avid.*
~feedback: That’s correct. This passage is encouraging you to read more often and more enthusiastically. 
2. Thankful or exceedingly humble
~feedback: That’s not correct. This passage has nothing to do with being thankful or humble, even though the word sounds similar to “gracious.”
3. Aloud or out loud
~feedback: That’s not correct. This passage doesn’t tell you whether to read aloud or silently: it’s just suggesting that you read more. 

### 1.3.2 Evaluate strategies for retaining new words
~file: retain_words_practice

Which of the following is a good strategy to retain new words?
1. Write them down in a personal lexicon.*
~feedback: That's correct. Recording a word will help you come back to it later. 
2. Use them in your next history paper.
~feedback: While this might help you remember the word, it might not be appropriate for every paper. Don't use big words just for the sake of using them. 
3. Create flashcards with the definitions. 
~feedback: Drill-based memorization methods are not as effective as actually using the words in context. 

Which of the following words is not based on the Latin root "brev" (meaning brief or short)?
1. Abbreviate
~feedback: That's incorrect. To abbreviate means to shorten a word or phrase. 
2. Brevity 
~feedback: That's incorrect. Brevity is the state of being short, or brief. 
3. Bravado* 
~feedback: Correct. Though "bravado" sounds similar to the "brev" root, it has a different origin. Bravado means "a bold manner or a show of boldness intended to impress or intimidate."

What is the meaning of the word "antithesis," based on the Latin root "anti" (against) and the Greek root "the" (position)?
1. A proposition that is the diametric opposite of some other proposition.*
~feedback: That's correct. The literal meaning is the opposite of the position. 
2. The state of being opposed to a certain location.
~feedback: That's incorrect. Position in this case is rhetorical rather than physical. 
3. A statement that doesn't make a claim. 
~feedback: That's incorrect. "Anti" doesn't mean "lack of"-- the root for that is "a" or "an."
