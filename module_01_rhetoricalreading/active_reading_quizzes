Highlighting promotes active reading.
~formative
1. True
~feedback: Incorrect. Highlighting merely indicates—vaguely—that you found a certain passage more important than the surrounding text. Highlighting doesn't involve having a conversation with a text.
2. False*

2. False
~feedback: Incorrect. Active readers "listen" to the text, evaluating what the writer says, checking to see if it matches or differs from their current understanding of the issue or idea.

Rachel has an exam in her Political Science class. In addition to covering lecture notes, the exam will feature a written response to a set of three short articles written by politicians from rural areas and how they have made an impact in Washington, D.C. What is the best way for Rachel to prepare before she reads the articles?
~formative
1. Talk to her classmates about which of the articles is most important so she can write about it the most.
~feedback: Incorrect. Though it might be helpful to talk to classmates about the articles, it is unlikely the professor expects students to determine one as most important and deserving of more attention. Think about rhetorical context.
2. Learn about the three politicians and their home areas so she better understands the rhetorical context for the articles.*
~feedback: Correct. Better understanding the rhetorical context for the writings may help Rachel provide deeper insight in her response.
3. Decide which article to focus on the most so she can read it more carefully and annotate it well.
~feedback: Incorrect. It is unlikely the professor expects students to determine one article as most important and deserving of more attention. Think about rhetorical context.

Steve is writing an analysis of a William Faulkner short story for his American Literature course. He read his assignment carefully three times; learned more about Faulkner on a website; read the story twice, annotating it each time; and made a short list of vocabulary words that he has looked up, studied, and used in other contexts. What is his best next step before drafting his paper?
~formative
1. Steve has completed all possible steps of the reading loop and should begin drafting.
~feedback: Incorrect. Though Steve has been thorough in his reading process so far, there are many other steps he can take to help expand his knowledge of the text, his own purpose, and the author's rhetorical context. 
2. Steve could meet with a classmate to discuss their thoughts on the text and the circumstances under which it was written.*
~feedback: Correct. Checking your comprehension (and perhaps furthering it) of a reading can be a valuable part of the process.
3. Steve should continue annotating the text because more notes is better when writing an analysis.
~feedback: Incorrect. More notes does not always mean better comprehension of a reading.

Rosalinda is reading a four-page, difficult passage about ethics in her Philosophy class. Which of the following is the best strategy while she reads?
~formative
1. Connect ideas from the passage to what she has learned about ethics in her church group.*
~feedback: Correct. Connecting a text to what you already know about a topic is a good reading strategy.
2. Read very small bits of the passage over several days to make sure she has plenty of time to think about the material.
~feedback: Incorrect. While taking a break during reading is often a good idea, reading a four-page passage shouldn't take several days. Perhaps she may re-read the passage after a break to help with comprehension.
3. Highlight all the parts she doesn't understand so she can focus on them later.
~feedback: Incorrect. While highlighting can be useful, think of annotating a text as having a conversation with it. Write questions, and try to pinpoint what it is that you don't understand so that you are actively thinking about the text.

Archie, your classmate, has been working with you to improve his reading skills. He tells you, "I'm trying to summarize this article for Professor Mehitabel's class. I can't seem to stop myself from just writing out everything in my own words. It's taking forever." Which response should you offer to help him get better with active reading?
~summative
1. "Archie, you've got to write down all the stuff in the headings and make an outline first. Then you can try summarizing based on that. A summary is just the article, only shorter."
2. "Archie, while working on active reading, don't worry about summarizing. Focus instead on marking words and concepts as you go, and make predictions about what is coming. Create a vocabulary list for the things to define later."*
3. "Archie, it sounds like you're paraphrasing rather than summarizing. Make sure your notes all use exact language from the article so that you can find the passages later when you are studying."

You just finished reading a long assignment and take a look at the pages of notes you made about it. How are you going to make sense of what you just read so that you don't forget it?
~summative
1. It is time to begin another reading of the book after a break. For the next reading, take notes on all of the parts you had difficulty with the first time and then talk about them with your professor.
2. It is time to take your notes and create an outline or concept map so that you can summarize the material. You read actively, annotating your text and making a vocabulary list, so you have the ingredients you need for a summary.*
3. It is time to look over the book to see how it is put together structurally. You need to make notes on the key questions you want to answer as you skim, and you need to review what you already know about the subject.

Tabitha completed the reading process loop by reviewing her Organic Chemistry reading notes. What advantage did she have over her classmates who only highlighted the key terms in the book?
~summative
1. Tabitha had physical proof that she actually read and could use her review concept maps and summaries as backup for an open note exam.
2. The review helped her recall the content because she made links between the concepts and the material she already knew. Now her new vocabulary terms have context for her.*
3. The concept maps, summaries, matrices, and group discussions she did provided evidence that she fully understood the material and was prepared for the quiz. 

One of your reading group members, Hunter, is reading over the section headings in the assigned chapters of your course's Biology textbook. He says he wants to get a better sense of the content of the two chapters before he reads them. What is your best response to help him with active reading?
~summative
1. "I would just get to the reading, Hunter. Our group wants to study for the test, so we need to discuss what the exam might cover."
2. "That is a good idea, Hunter. If you know the main parts of the chapters, you might not need to read all the pages and still be covered for the test."
3. "That is a good idea, Hunter. It will help you think about possible relationships in the material and how the text is structured."* 

Your friend Christina meets you for lunch early in the semester and says she doesn't understand what's going on in the Art History class she is taking and that you took last semester. You remember that you did well in the class but it took a lot of careful reading to be prepared for the exams and to write the term paper. Christina says she has blown off the required reading and now feels overwhelmed. What is your best advice for your friend?
~summative
1. You tell Christina that she should go meet with the professor and explain that she doesn't know what is going on the course and needs help with what to read.
2. You tell Christina that she should talk to classmates about the reading that she hasn't done so she can get a better sense of what she has missed so far.
3. You tell Christina that she should start by looking over the course goals and upcoming assignments so she better understands her rhetorical context as a reader.*
