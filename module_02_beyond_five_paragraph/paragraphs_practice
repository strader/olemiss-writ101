Which sentence is the topic, or key, sentence in this paragraph? 
1. The phenomenon of red-eye can be lessened by using the red-eye reduction feature found on many SLR cameras.*
~feedback: Correct. The topic sentence is not always at the beginning of a paragraph. In this case, the topic sentence is closer to the middle of the paragraph. The first two sentences provide background and buildup for the topic sentence. 
2. When a camera flash is used in a low-light environment, the subject's eyes may appear red in the finished photograph.
~feedback: That's not correct. The topic sentence is not always at the beginning of a paragraph. In this case, the topic sentence is closer to the middle of the paragraph. The first two sentences provide background and buildup for the topic sentence. 
3. Since a smaller pupil means a smaller host for the reflection, the chances of red-eye occurring are greatly reduced.
~feedback: That's not correct. The last sentences of this paragraph provide support for the topic sentence, which occurs closer to the middle.

From the organizational schemes you learned in this section, which one best fits this paragraph? 
1. Spatial*
~feedback: Correct: Julius Caesar is describing the geography of Gaul. He structures his description based on the location of river and landforms and how they divide different groups of inhabitants. 
2. Chronological
~feedback: That's not correct. Julius Caesar is describing the geography of Gaul. He structures his description based on the location of river and landforms and how they divide different groups of inhabitants. He doesn't establish a timeline or sequence of events in this paragraph. 
3. Rank Order
~feedback: That's not correct. Julius Caesar is describing the geography of Gaul. He structures his description based on the location of rivers and landforms and how they divide different groups of inhabitants. Though he does classify these inhabitants ("the bravest"), the paragraph is still organized based on the physical layout of Gaul.

Kate wrote the paragraph below in her paper about technology use among children. What revision advice would you give her? 
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Furthermore, there are some negative impacts of the electronic revolution in our daily lives, especially in the lives of our children. Children are our future and it is important that we raise them well. These days iPhones and smartphones are affordable which has made it relatively easy for our children to gain access to all kinds of social media websites that either expose them to dangers or negative influences that impact their social life and more importantly their education.</p>
1. Kate should remove or revise the sentence "Children are our future and it is important that we raise them well" because it is a digression that interrupts the logical flow of the paragraph.*
~feedback: Correct. This sentence is out of place. It might fit elsewhere in Kate's paper (like her conclusion), but it doesn't fit here.
2. Kate should list other types of smartphones in order to be more specific and detailed in her description. 
~feedback: That's incorrect. In some cases, it makes sense to be more specific. But adding a list of smartphone brands would not add anything to this paragraph. It would distract from Kate's main point. 
3. Kate should write "there are some negative and positive impacts" in the first sentence so she is giving equal consideration to other viewpoints. 
~feedback: That's incorrect. This paragraph is specifically about negative impacts; though there may be positive impacts, it would be out of place to discuss them here.
