Bobby is writing an argument paper with a main claim that Major League Baseball needs to implement some rule changes to get younger fans interested in watching the sport. Which of the following is the best option for the first sentence of his introduction?
~formative
1. According to Merriam-Webster, the definition of baseball is "a game played with a bat and ball between two team of nine players each on a large field having four bases that mark the corners a runner must take to score."
~feedback: Incorrect. Most readers are familiar with baseball and don't need a dictionary definition to get them thinking about the topic.
2. Higher television ratings in the coming years will help the sport of baseball make the transition into an era of fans watching sports on the go with digital devices. 
~feedback: Incorrect. This sentence makes a prediction about the future of baseball and is more suited for a conclusion, after Robby has written his thesis statement and support.
3. The game of baseball is called "America's Pastime" and has been played professionally in the United States for about a century-and-half, but the sport's originators could have never anticipated keeping modern fans glued to televisions sets day after day for more than six months each year.*
~feedback: Correct. This sentence hits some of the goals of orienting readers such as providing background, locating readers in a specific time and place, and laying out the stakes for Robby's piece of writing.

Read the following passage and determine where it would best fit in a reflective essay: Looking over my work carefully has caused me to change the way I think about reading tasks. Because I struggled so much with reading comprehension this semester, beginning in the spring I plan to move my study time out of my dorm and into the library. I want to commit to at least five hours a week of reading in the library and see how my grades turn out in the coming semester. If I see a noticeable improvement, I think I will have committed myself to a worthwhile experiment. If not, I will have at least gained the knowledge from a lot of reading in a less-distracting environment.

Samantha is writing an advertisement analysis paper in her Composition class. Her ad is for De Beers diamonds, and in her introduction she notes the company's slogan: "A Diamond is Forever." As she writes her conclusion, Samantha emphasizes her thesis statement with fresh language and considers ending with another reference to the slogan. Is this a good strategy in a conclusion?
~formative
1. No. Samantha shouldn't repeat anything in her paper.
~feedback: Incorrect. Using a "bookend" or "call back" is often an effective strategy in a conclusion. 
2. No. Samantha should avoid writing anything but a recap of her thesis statement and main points of support in the conclusion.
~feedback: Incorrect. Â Using a "bookend" or "call back" is often an effective strategy in a conclusion. Also, simply repeating exactly what has been already written is not a great way to end a paper.
3. Yes. Samantha should refer back to an idea she brought up in the introduction if she thinks it fits her work.*
~feedback: Correct. Using a "bookend" or "call back" is often an effective strategy in a conclusion.

Which of the following sentences would work best to start an introduction in an argument paper on how families can work together to cut back on social media use?
~summative
1. Cell phones - everyone has them these days, and no one is able to stay off them for more than five seconds.
2. Parents probably already know that their kids spend a lot of time on digital devices, but a 2016 study shows teens on average spend close to a whopping nine hours per day on social media.*
3. It is my contention that families do not spend enough time doing traditional activities like exercising, playing board games, and eating together; therefore, I suggest they limit social media use to one hour per day to leave more time for other things.

Nina is writing her conclusion to an Urban Planning project where she spent part of the semester interviewing people at homeless shelters. She realized during her interviews that many of the homeless people wanted badly to work but needed a permanent address for job applications. Thus, her paper evolved into a plan to open a series of halfway houses that could help reduce the city's homeless population while helping to fill some positions that stay open or experience high turnover. Which of the following passages would best fit in her conclusion?
~summative
1. As you can see from the data provided, we have the financial capacity and a clear economic purpose to create halfway homes that would provide permanent addresses for many of the city's homeless; however, we should do so not simply for these reasons but because it is the right action to take in terms of helping our less fortunate citizens find greater meaning and a chance at more happiness in their lives.* 
2. One potential solution to help our city reduce the homeless population and fill open jobs is to create halfway houses. Such residences would allow homeless people to establish a permanent address and broaden their job opportunities, resulting in a long-term win-win for the city and its residents.
3. The city of Rebelville has a homeless population estimated at over 300 people, which is an alarmingly high number for a city of around 20,000 people. Many residents are completely unaware that there are any homeless people at all in the area.

Read the following short introduction paragraph from a thesis-driven Literary Analysis assignment and determine which is the best organizational structure: Bierce uses images of fire, heat, and light versus darkness to create a religious struggle within Peyton Fahrquhar. Though Ambrose Bierce was renowned for his keen sense of humor, his short story "An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge" is anything but witty. The story appears to readers to be a tale of Civil War soldier Fahrquhar's last minutes before his death by hanging. Underneath the surface, Bierce is telling a story of a man's struggle between Heaven and Hell, and then, the final moments that decide his fate.
~summative
1. The structure is fine as is for an introduction.
2. The introduction would work better if what is currently the first sentence became the final sentence of the paragraph in order to better build up to the thesis statement.*
3. The introduction would work better if the student added more analysis in support of the thesis statement.
