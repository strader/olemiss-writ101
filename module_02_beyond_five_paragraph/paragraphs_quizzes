### 2.2.2 Evaluate paragraph construction
// self-check 

Analyze this paragraph from the body of a research paper. Is it an effective paragraph? Why or why not?
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Vuoskoski and Eerola in their study titled "Can Sad Music Really Make You Sad? Indirect Measures of Affective States Induced by Music and Autobiographical Memories" focus on the emotion of sadness. Their research starts with four groupings: sad music picked by them, neutral music, sad music picked out by the participants, and sad recall. The participants listened to these and then were asked to remember words that they had heard before listening. The results of the experiment were that in the first two categories (sad music chosen and neutral music) the amount of positive and negative words remembered were roughly equal; in the third category of sad music chosen individually there was a notable difference and even more of one in sad recall (Vuoskoski and Eerola 208).</p>
~formative
1. This paragraph lacks purpose, and could be strengthened with a key sentence.*
2. The paragraph would be stronger if the author quoted more and paraphrased less.
3. This is a strong paragraph because it focuses on explaining one piece of research. 
 
Identify the logical problems in this paragraph:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> Financial strain, work and family conflict, and marital dissatisfaction may be bi-products of the emotional and time commitments dual income families generate. For the majority of dual income families, the women feel more of the gender inequality with regards to parental responsibilities and thus are linked to greater distress and anger. The good mother model is inflexible and maintains that mothers are to be involved, always available and committed to the family. Furthermore, the father role appears to be more flexible as they are seen as both breadwinners and caregivers. With this flexibility come social expectations that foster more time for enjoyment.  Given these circumstances, fathers may not experience the stress and role strain that working mothers feel.  </p>
~formative
1. "Furthermore" is the wrong transitional word to indicate contrast.*
2. There is nothing to introduce the concept of the "good mother" and it reads like a tangent. *
3. "Given these circumstances" is the wrong transitional phrase to show causation or correlation. 
4. The last sentence is the most important claim, so it should be at the beginning of the paragraph. 
 
How could the sentences in this paragraph be organized more logically? Put the sentences in order by number. 
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[1] Depression can lead to a variety of issues, and in the latest study, research has begun showing that women experience higher rates of depression compared to men. [2] Since the female mind matures before males in terms of emotions and sensitivity it makes them more exposed to depression and anxiety. [3] The way that scientists have discovered the difference between the way girls and boys process emotions is through brain scans that show the different "emotional stimuli." [4] There are definitely symptoms that one can spot, so if someone sees any symptoms in a person they can try and help them. [5] Symptoms to watch for would include "changes in her mood, including sadness or irritability, or in her behavior, including, appetite, energy level, sleep patterns and academic performance." [6] The first thing to notice is withdrawal or even just when the girl stops doing activities she usually loves doing.</p>

True or False: The bold sentence in the paragraph below is the key/topic sentence:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Thus we may hint at the greater, more serious, phase of the road problem.</strong> Beside it, the financial feature of the problem can have no place; the farm has been too much to the American nation, its product of boys and girls has been too eternally precious to the cause of liberty for which our nation stands, to permit a system of highways on this continent which will make it a place where now in the twentieth century foreigners, only, can be happy. The sociological side of the road question is of more moment today in this country, so far as the health of our body politic in the future is concerned, than nine-tenths of the questions most prominent in the two political platforms that come annually before the people.

Identify the logical problems in this paragraph: 
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The "prison industrial complex" is a term that describes a complex interlocking web of institutions that extends outward beyond any one jail or prison into the larger political economy and loops back to the thousands of jails and prisons that house men and women for crimes for which they have been convicted. Prisoners are alienated and forced to work to reduce the time for their crimes, and some are often not compensated at all. Major corporations like Wal-Mart, JC Penny, AT&T, and ExxonMobil were among a few notable companies that participate in the exploitation of the prison labor. The prison industrial complex is like a hungry lion that has to be fed and its growth has been substantial. This enterprise is governed by the principles of earning a profit for the private sector rather than fulfilling basic human needs.</p>
~summative
1. Metaphors like "the prison industrial complex is a hungry lion" disrupt the coherence of the paragraph. 
2. The sentence "this enterprise is governed by the principles of earning profit for the private sector rather than fulfilling basic human needs" should be at the beginning of the paragraph.
3. A strong transitional phrase before "major corporations like Wal-Mart" would make the message more clear. 
4. The paragraph has no logical problems*

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> [1] Such judgment and criticism may often lead to feelings of guilt and anxiety, more so for mothers than fathers. [2] In contrast, fathers returning to the workforce after the birth of their child are considered professional and responsible.  [3] Working mothers are also perceived as less committed to the family than non-working mothers. [4] One gender stereotype suggests that women who return to work following the birth of a child are considered less competent than those women in the workforce without children. </p>
