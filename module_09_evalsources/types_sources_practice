Take a look at the banner image from <em>The Washington Post</em>. Would this source be considered “print” or “online,” and why? <img src =”/assets/types_practice_1.png” alt=”Image of the Washington Post page header, including the date of publication, the print-styled logo of the paper, and a link to the current edition the viewer is accessing.”>
1. Print Source: Even though the newspaper can be accessed online, it is still published in print form, and follows the conventions of a print newspaper. *
~feedback: That’s correct. <em>The Washington Post</em> is considered a credible, well-respected newspaper, and would generally be categorized as a print source. Keep in mind that some parts of the <em>Post’s</em> website are more problematic, like blogs and interactive media content. 
2. Online Source: Because the source is viewed on a webpage, it’s always considered an online source, regardless of the medium of original publication. 
~feedback: That’s incorrect. Just because you accessed the source online does not mean it was originally online. <em>The Washington Post</em> has been publishing since long before the internet, and it adheres to the conventions of a traditional print newspaper. Most content from its website should be considered a “print” source. 
3. Print Source: Because all news sources, whether accessed online or not, are considered print sources. 
~feedback: That’s incorrect. Many online news sources, like <em>The Drudge Report</em> or <em>Buzzfeed</em> publish online only. Though they may be good sources to use in some contexts, they cannot be considered “print” sources because they adhere to different publishing conventions. 

True or False: You should never use information you found on Wikipedia in a research project. 
1. False.*
~feedback: That’s correct. You may have been warned of the evils of Wikipedia (or other online sources) in the past, but all sources have an appropriate context. There is nothing inherently wrong or right about Wikipedia: like any other online source, you have to evaluate it for credibility and reliability before you decide if you can use it.
