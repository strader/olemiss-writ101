While studying recent breakthroughs in autism research, James finds a news clip from 1978 in which a doctor is interviewed about his research about the causes of autism. This is a poor source for James to use because…
~formative
1. Currency is important to James’s research, and an interview from 1978 would not provide current information about research into the causes of autism.*
~feedback: That’s correct. Unless James was researching the changes in beliefs about the causes of autism, a source this old would not be useful. 
2. The doctor being interviewed is not an authority on the subject of autism. 
~feedback: That’s incorrect. Whether the doctor is an authority in 1978 is besides the point: the source is too old to use for James’s research. 
3. The source is irrelevant to the subject of James’s research.
~feedback: That’s incorrect. James is studying recent breakthroughs in autism research. This would be a useful source if it were current. 

Which of these examples is a source with authority to address the use of fidget spinners as a coping tool for ADHD patients?
~formative
1. Dr. JoAnn Comey, a pediatrician with several publications in child psychiatry journals, explains why ADHD patients can use objects like fidget spinners to reduce their anxiety in an informational video for a psychiatrist’s office. 
~feedback: That’s correct. Dr. Comey has the authority to speak on this subject because of her expertise and her background.
2. John T. McBlytheville, the president and C.E.O of Fidgets 4 U, Inc., claims in a video advertisement that his fidget spinners can reduce anxiety in children with ADHD by 98%. 
~feedback: That’s incorrect. Though Mr. McBlytheville has expertise about fidget spinners, he also has a bias: he wants to sell his products. He also does not have the background to make statements about psychological efficacy. 
3. SuperDadAlexander, a popular YouTube user, posts a video of his child, Sue Ann Alexander (who has a temper and an ADHD diagnosis) destroying the dining room at Golden Corral. When she is given a fidget spinner, she sits down and quietly returns to her pudding with the fidget spinner in hand.
~feedback: That’s incorrect. Anecdotal experience is not sufficient evidence for authority. There are too many other variables at play in this source for it to be considered credible. 

True or False: A podcast about grave robbers in Woolsey, Georgia could be a good source to use for a research project about the history of grave robbery in the American South. 
~formative
1. True*
~feedback: That’s correct. This podcast could provide relevant information for the research project, especially if it discusses historical context.
2. False
~feedback: That’s incorrect. Though you can’t be certain of its usefulness, it’s very clear that the source is relevant to the research project.
