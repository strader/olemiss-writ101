## 9.2 Evaluate methods to assess the quality of print sources
### 9.2.1 Apply the CRAAP analysis method to evaluate print sources

While researching a paper on the decline of the coal industry, a student finds a 2016 study quantifying U.S. coal reserves, written a team of Georgia Tech geology professors and published in the academic journal, <em>Marine and Petroleum Geology</em>.  This source meets the criteria of “authority” in the student’s CRAAP analysis because:
~formative
1. Georgia Tech has a highly regarded school of geological engineering, and <em>Marine and Petroleum Geology</em> is a highly regarded journal in the field of geology.*
~feedback: Correct. The key question for “authority:”  Is the person, organization, or institution responsible for the content of the print source knowledgeable in that subject?
2. The study is related to the student’s topic.
~feedback: Incorrect.  While the study does meet the demand of “relevance” by being related to the student’s topic, it does not meet the demand of “authority.”  Remember the key question for “authority:” Is the person, organization, or institution responsible for the content of the print source knowledgeable in that subject?
3. The study is from 2016.
~feedback: Incorrect.  While the study does meet the demand of “currency” by being up-to-date, it does not meet the demand of “authority.”  Remember the key question for “authority”: Is the person, organization, or institution responsible for the content of the print source knowledgeable in that subject?

While researching a paper on the causes of human-influenced climate change, a student receives in her mail a Green Party candidate’s campaign flier, which includes some uncited statistics about human-induced climate change.  After performing a CRAAP analysis, she decides not to use the source because:
~formative
1. The source is not related to the paper topic, so it does not satisfy the relevance criteria.
~feedback: Incorrect.  The flier is related to the student’s topic so it meets the criteria of relevancy.  
2. The source is not a print source.  
~feedback: The flier is a print source.  Remember that a print source is a source that has been published in print.
3. The purpose of the flier is candidate advocacy so it is subject to bias and the authority of the information is in question because the source of the statistics is uncited.*
~feedback: Correct. The flier does not meet the criteria of purpose and authority.
