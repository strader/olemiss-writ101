### 10.3.1 Identify the conventions of citation and references 

<p>Identify the error in the following citation:</p><p>Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin. Remediation: Understanding New Media. Cambridge: MIT Press, 1999.</p>
~formative
1. The word order of the author’s name should be “Bolter, Jay David.”*
~feedback: That’s correct. Because the works cited page is alphabetical by author last name, the last name should come first in the citation. 
2. Understanding New Media should be underlined.
~feedback. Incorrect. According to the most recent MLA style guide, titles of books and periodicals should be italicized. 
3.  The city of publication should come after the name of the published (MIT Press, Cambridge). 
~feedback: Incorrect: The city of publication always comes first.
4. There is nothing wrong with this citation.
~feedback: Incorrect. Take a look at the citation’s word order. 

What citation is in the correct order?
~formative
1. Hudson-Smith, Andrew, Michael Batty, Andrew Crooks, and Richard Milton. “Mapping for the Masses: Accessing Web 2.0 Through Crowdsourcing.” Social Science Computer Review, 27, 2009, pp. 524-538.*
~feedback: Correct!
2. Hudson-Smith, Andrew, Michael Batty, Andrew Crooks, and Richard Milton. Social Science Computer Review,  “Mapping for the Masses: Accessing Web 2.0 Through Crowdsourcing,” 27, 2009, pp. 524-538.
~feedback: That’s incorrect. The title of an article should always come before the title of a journal.
3. Hudson-Smith, Andrew, Michael Batty, Andrew Crooks, and Richard Milton. (2009). “Mapping for the Masses: Accessing Web 2.0 Through Crowdsourcing.” Social Science Computer Review, 27, pp. 524-538.
~feedback: That’s incorrect. The year goes after the author’s name(s) in APA style, but in MLA it goes closer to the end of a citation. 

<p>What is the correct revision of the following incorrect citation?</p><p>David Beer, Roger Burros. (Sept. 2007)  Sociology and, of, and in Web 2.0.: Some Initial Considerations. Vol. 12  “Sociological Research Online,” issue 5. </p>
~formative
1. Beer, David & Roger Burrows. “Sociology and, of, and in Web 2.0: Some Initial Considerations.” Sociological Research Online, vol. 12, issue 5, September 2007, n.p.*
~feedback: That’s correct! 
2. Beed, David & Roger Burrons.” (2007). “Sociology and, of, and in Web 2.0: Some Initial Considerations.” Sociological Research Online, vol. 12, issue 5, n.p.

### 10.3.2 Interpret the conventions of citation and references

<p>Does the citation below have an error? If so, how does the error take away from the meaning of the citation? </p><p>Hopmann, David N., et al. "Contagious Media Effects: How Media use and Exposure to Game-Framed News Influence Media Trust." EBSCOhost, vol. 18, no. 6, 2015., pp. 776. </p>
~formative
1. EBSCOHost is the name of a database, not a journal. Journal articles can be accessed by many different databases, but without the title of the journal, a reader may have a hard time finding the original article.* 
2. The year of publication, 2015, should come after the author’s name in order for the citation to have correct MLA style. 
3. The author “et al” should come before “Hopmann, David N.” because authors should be listed alphabetically. 
4. There is nothing wrong with this citation. 

<p>Does the citation below have an error? If so, how does the error take away from the meaning of the citation?</p><p>"Do Citizens (not Police Officers) with Guns Ever Stop Mass Shootings?" The Washington Post., n.d. Web. 03 Nov. 2016.</p>
~formative
1. The error is n.d., signifying “no date.” The Washington Post is a daily newspaper, and newspaper articles will always be associated with a date. The date of publication is important in news articles because they are time-sensitive.*
2. The error is that “Washington Post” should not be italicized.  Titles of full-length works, like newspapers, should be in quotation marks.  This distinction is important because readers may need to know what type of publication this article comes from.
3. The error is no author is listed.  All newspaper articles list authors.  Without knowing the author, it would be difficult to find the article.
4. There is nothing wrong with this citation.

<p>Does the citation below have an error? If so, how does the error take away from the meaning of the citation?</p><p>Professor of Economics, Rhodes University, Snow, Jen. "Why Art and Culture Contribute More to an Economy than Growth and Jobs." The Conversation. N.p., 19 Jan. 2016. Web. 28 Oct. 2016.</p>
~formative
1. The error is in the author’s name. The author’s title, Professor of Economics at Rhodes University, should not appear in the Works Cited entry.  The author’s name should appear first in the entry because that ensures that the source is easily searchable. In addition, knowing the author’s title may not be relevant as, for instance, the author may have moved on to a new position.*
2. The error is in the order.  The title of the publication should come before the title of the article.  This is important because most databases search by publication rather than title.
3. The error is in the punctuation.  There should be a comma, not a period, after the author’s first name.  This is important because the author has ownership of the article and the comma identifies that ownership.
4. There is nothing wrong with this citation.
